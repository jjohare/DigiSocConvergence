However, many of the present approaches of interactive distributed visualization are based on the traditional polygonal processing graphics pipeline. Our research is centred on investigating an alternative method using image-based rendering (IBR) which uses (multiple) images of the scene instead of a 3D geometrical representation. A key advantage to the use of IBR techniques is that the bandwidth required is independent of scene complexity and is therefore predictable given knowledge of the desired final image resolution. In this paper, we describe our IBR based interactive distributed visualization platform involving light field rendering and present results which indicate the scalability of our approach to accommodate multiple collaborative users. To our knowledge this is the first system to demonstrate deployment of interactive light field rendering to large numbers of distributed users.},

The proposed distribution scheme ensures scalability of the system and hereby allows control over the number of cameras used for acquisition, the frame-rate, or the number of projectors used for high resolution visualization. To our knowledge this is the first completely scalable vision architecture for real time 3D modeling, from acquisition to visualization through computation.

	abstract     = {Purpose-- The purpose of this study is to propose a taxonomy of meeting purpose. Meetings are a workplace activity that deserves increased attention from researchers and practitioners. Previous researchers attempted to develop typologies of meeting purpose with limited success. Through a comparison of classification methodologies, the authors consider a taxonomy as the appropriate classification scheme for meeting purpose. The authors then utilize the developed taxonomy to investigate the frequency with which a representative sample of working adults engaged in meetings of these varying purposes. Their proposed taxonomy provides relevant classifications for future research on meetings as well and serves as a useful tool for managers seeking to use and evaluate the effectiveness of meetings within their organizations. Design/methodology/approach-- This study employs an inductive methodology using discourse analysis of qualitative meeting descriptions to develop a taxonomy of meeting purpose. The authors discourse analysis utilizes open-ended survey responses from a sample of working adults (n = 491). Findings-- The authors categorical analysis of open-ended questions resulted in a 16-category taxonomy of meeting purpose. The two most prevalent meeting purpose categories in this sample were ``to discuss ongoing projects'' at 11.6 per cent and ``to routinely discuss the state of the business'' at 10.8 per cent. The two least common meeting purpose categories in this sample were ``to brainstorm for ideas or solutions'' at 3.3 per cent and ``to discuss productivity and efficiencies'' at 3.7 per cent. The taxonomy was analyzed across organizational type and employee job level to identify differences between those important organizational and employee characteristics. Research limitations/implications-- The data suggested that meetings were institutionalized in organizations, making them useful at identifying differences between organizations as well as differences in employees in terms of scope of responsibility. Researchers and managers should consider the purposes for which they call meetings and how that manifests their overarching organizational focus, structure and goals. Originality/value-- This is the first study to overtly attempt to categorize the various purposes for which meetings are held. Further, this study develops a taxonomy of meeting purposes that will prove useful for investigating the different types of meeting purposes in a broad range of organizational types and structures.},

In both studies, participant gender, virtual human gender, virtual human gaze behavior, and whether virtual humans were allegedly controlled by humans (i.e., avatars) or computers (i.e., agents) were varied. Results indicated that participants maintained greater distance from virtual humans when approaching their fronts compared to their backs. In addition, participants gave more personal space to virtual agents who engaged them in mutual gaze. Moreover, when virtual humans invaded their personal space, participants moved farthest from virtual human agents.

In the study we utilized state of the art, real-time face tracking technology to track and render facial expressions unobtrusively in a desktop CVE. Participants in dyads interacted with each other via either a video-conference (high behavioral realism and high form realism), voice only (low behavioral realism and low form realism), or an ?emotibox? that rendered the dimensions of facial expressions abstractly in terms of color, shape, and orientation on a rectangular polygon (high behavioral realism and low form realism). Verbal and non-verbal self-disclosure were lowest in the videoconference condition while self-reported copresence and success of transmission and identification of emotions were lowest in the emotibox condition. Previous work demonstrates that avatar realism increases copresence while decreasing self-disclosure. We discuss the possibility of a hybrid realism solution that maintains high copresence without lowering self-disclosure, and the benefits of such an avatar on applications such as distance learning and therapy.},

We present an end-to-end system capable of capturing and real-time displaying of high-quality light-field video content on various HoloVizio light-field displays, providing very high 3D image quality and continuous motion parallax. The system is compact in terms of number of computers, and provides superior image quality, resolution and frame rate compared to other published systems. To generate light-field content, we have built a camera system with a large number of cameras and connected them to PC computers. The cameras were in an evenly spaced linear arrangement. The capture PC was directly connected through a single gigabit Ethernet connection to the demonstration 3D display, supported by a PC computation cluster. For the task of dense light field displaying massively parallel reordering and filtering of the original camera images is required. We were utilizing both CPU and GPU threads for this task. On the GPU we do the light-field conversion and reordering, filtering and the YUV-RGB conversion. We use OpenGL 3.0 shaders and 2D texture arrays to have easy access to individual camera images. A network-based synchronization scheme is used to present the final rendered images.},

We describe a real-time system for applying virtual paint and textures to real objects simply by direct physical manipulation of the object and a ``paint brush'' stylus. We track the objects and the ``paint brush'', and illuminate the objects with images that remain registered as they move, to create the illusion of material properties. The system is simple to use and we hope it may herald new applications in diverse fields such as visualization, tele-immersion, art and architecture. The system currently works with tracked objects whose geometry was pre-acquired and models created manually, but it is possible to extend it by adding cameras to the environment, to acquire object geometry automatically and use vision-based tracking for the object and paintbrush. Plus colour plates.},

In this paper we describe an empirical study that attempts to plot Mori's hypothesized curve. In addition, the influence of framing on the users' perception of the stimuli was investigated. Framing had no significant influence on the measurements. The pictures of robots and humans were rated independently of whether the participants knew a particular picture showed a robot or human. Anthropomorphism had a significant influence on the measurements, but not even pictures of real humans were rated as likeable as the pictures of humanoids or toy robots. As a result we suggest the existence of an uncanny cliff model as an alternative to the uncanny valley model. However, this study focused on the perception of pictures of robots and the results, including the suggested model, may be different for the perception of movies of moving robots or the perception of standing right in front of a moving robot.},

We extend research on faultlines by showing how different faultline bases (social category and information-based faultlines) may have differential effects on the performance of groups. In addition to faultline strength (the extent of demographic alignment across members within a group), we examine the distance between faultline-based subgroups (e.g., two members of age 20 are closer in age to two members of an opposing subgroup of age 25 than of two members of age 50). We test our model using an archival field methodology and multiple-source data (qualitative and quantitative) from 76 workgroups in a Fortune 500 information-processing company. Our results revealed that groups with social category faultlines had low team discretionary awards. Faultline distance further exacerbated the negative effects of strength in groups with social category faultlines and produced similarly negative effects in groups with information-based faultlines. Team identification served as a moderator enhancing performance of groups with information-based faultlines.},

Such three-dimensional (3D) images, or holograms, can be seen with the unassisted eye and are very similar to how humans see the actual environment surrounding them. The concept of 3D telepresence, a real-time dynamic hologram depicting a scene occurring in a different location, has attracted considerable public interest since it was depicted in the original Star Wars film in 1977. However, the lack of sufficient computational power to produce realistic computer-generated holograms and the absence of large-area and dynamically updatable holographic recording media have prevented realization of the concept. Here we use a holographic stereographic technique and a photorefractive polymer material as the recording medium to demonstrate a holographic display that can refresh images every two seconds. A 50\textbackslashquotesinglbase{\"A}{\^a}Hz nanosecond pulsed laser is used to write the holographic pixels. Multicoloured holographic 3D images are produced by using angular multiplexing, and the full parallax display employs spatial multiplexing. 3D telepresence is demonstrated by taking multiple images from one location and transmitting the information via Ethernet to another location where the hologram is printed with the quasi-real-time dynamic 3D display. Further improvements could bring applications in telemedicine, prototyping, advertising, updatable 3D maps and entertainment.},

By minimizing the difference between the projections of reconstructed visual hull and the silhouette images using graphics hardware, the optimization can finally converge to accurate camera parameters and realistic visual hull efficiently and robustly. Using this method, we can automatically create photorealistic 3D models directly from images.},

We investigated the capability of human 'receivers' to single out one of many objects, defined by the gaze of a human or computer 'sender'. Deviations from the sender's target were normally distributed and judgements were highly accurate. Accuracy of gaze following under binocular and monocular vision of the receiver did not differ, but performance was poorer when only one of the sender's eyes was visible. Two types of systematic bias could be identified: upward bias and cardinal-axis bias. In summary, human gaze following is not only very precise but also surprisingly robust to manipulations of the sender cues available for guiding the receiver's eyes.},

An individual speaking with a woman tends to nod his or her head more than when speaking with a man. Is this due to social expectation or due to coupled motion dynamics between the speakers? We present a novel methodology that allows us to randomly assign apparent identity during free conversation in a video-conference, thereby dissociating apparent sex from motion dynamics. The method uses motion-tracked synthesized avatars that are accepted by naive participants as being live video. We find that 1) motion dynamics affect head movements but that apparent sex does not; 2) judgments of sex are driven almost entirely by appearance; and 3) ratings of masculinity and femininity rely on a combination of both appearance and dynamics. Together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis of separate perceptual streams for appearance and biological motion. In addition, our results are consistent with a view that head movements in conversation form a low level perception and action system that can operate independently from top-down social expectations.},

This paper discusses the strength of four existing models describing communications media use in individuals and organizations. The paper also presents research which evaluated interactions of multiple situation variables affecting communications media appropriateness in a survey population. Participants rated die acceptability of each of twelve communications media in each of eight hypothetical organizational situations. Situations varied based on high or low levels of three factors: message urgency, amount of message content, and distance between communicators. Results indicated (1) situations have unique and significant contributions to media appropriateness; (2) appropriateness of media usage depends on the match between situation requirements and media characteristics, and (3) situation effects are more salient in some ?situation-dependent? media. Another survey of 1072 voice mail users confirmed die validity and reliability of these results.},

Together these two facets of social cognition create one of the most influential and important social sciences to come along in some time. Providing a comprehensive review of major topics in the field of social cognition, The Oxford Handbook of Social Cognition expresses that excitement and fascination in describing the content and approach that constitute the field today. The 43 chapters included in this handbook cover: - central aspects of the field of social cognition, including its history and historically important foundational research areas (attribution, attitudes, impression formation, and prejudice/stereotyping), along with methodology - core issues relating to social cognitive representations and processes (including those that are visual, implicit, or automatic) and the stages of information processing (attention, perception, memory, and judgment, along with simulation and thought suppression) - applications of the social cognition approach to areas of social psychology, general psychology, and other disciplines, such as marketing, law, health and politics After more than 30 years, the vibrant field of social cognition continues to reign as one of psychology's most dominant approaches. The impressive chapters collected in this volume define the field and contribute enormously to our understanding of what social cognition is today.},

The authors suggest that the mechanism involved is the perception-behavior link, the recently documented finding (e.g., J. A. Bargh, M. Chen, \& L. Burrows, 1996) that the mere perception of another's behavior automatically increases the likelihood of engaging in that behavior oneself. Experiment 1 showed that the motor behavior of participants unintentionally matched that of strangers with whom they worked on a task. Experiment 2 had confederates mimic the posture and movements of participants and showed that mimicry facilitates the smoothness of interactions and increases liking between interaction partners. Experiment 3 showed that dispositionally empathic individuals exhibit the chameleon effect to a greater extent than do other people.},

It is generated from the 3D binary array of the object it represents. However, the acquisition of a 3D array is not a trivial problem. In this study, we propose a scheme to generate an octree of an object from its three orthogonal views (silhouettes) exploiting a volume intersection technique. A multi-level boundary search algorithm is developed to incorporate surface information into the octree representation. This makes the octree representation compact, informative, and especially useful for graphic displays and object recognition tasks. An algorithm is also designed for computing the moment of inertia matrix, which is useful for object recognition. All the algorithms developed in this study are essentially tree traversal procedures and therefore are suitable for implementation on parallel processors.},

While these devices enable high parallelism with huge amount of processing elements, the utilization of their capabilities in general scientific applications are still low due to their difficult programming paradigms. Therefore an open standard, OpenCL, is proposed to provide universal APIs and programming paradigms for various GPUs and accelerators. In this study, it adopts several benchmarks, with various computation characteristics, to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenCL with several platforms. These programs are parallelized by OpenMP and OpenCL, and then targeted on several GPUs and conventional servers. This paper also provides an example to illustrate the migration of the given program, from OpenMP to OpenCL. The presented experimental results show that these inexpensive GPUs will lead better performance than servers if adopt OpenCL paradigms. It will be the preliminary milestone of cheap supercomputing by the acceleration of GPUs that can be obtained ubiquitously.},

Given the video streams acquired by two cameras placed on either side of a computer monitor, the proposed algorithm synthesizes images from a virtual camera in arbitrary position (typically located within the monitor) to facilitate eye contact. Our technique is based on an improved, dynamic-programming, stereo algorithm for efficient novel-view generation. The two main contributions are: i) a new type of three-plane graph for dense-stereo dynamic-programming, that encourages correct occlusion labeling; ii) a compact geometric derivation for novel-view synthesis by direct projection of the minimum-cost surface. Furthermore, we present a novel algorithm for the temporal maintenance of a background model to enhance the rendering of occlusions and reduce temporal artefacts (flicker); and a cost aggregation algorithm that acts directly on our three-dimensional matching cost space. Examples are given that demonstrate the robustness of the new algorithm to spatial and temporal artefacts for long stereo video streams. These include demonstrations of synthesis of cyclopean views of extended conversational sequences. We further demonstrate synthesis from a freely translating virtual camera.},

The techniques were evaluated in the context of an urban planning application, by providing one batch of participants with MGDs and another with an interface based on conventional collaborative virtual environments (CVEs). Participants with MGDs spent nearly twice as much time in close proximity (within 10m of their nearest neighbor), communicated seven times more than participants with a conventional interface, and exhibited real-world patterns of behavior such as staying together over an extended period of time and regrouping after periods of separation. The study has implications for CVE designers, because it shows how MGDs improves groupwork in CVEs.},

With multimedia communication environments becoming more commonplace, what have we learned from earlier experiences with prototype media environments? This paper reports on some of our experiences as developers, researchers and users of flexible, networked, multimedia computer environments, or ``media spaces''. It focusses on the lessons we can learn from extended, long-term use of media spaces, with connections that last not hours or days, but months or years. We take as our starting point a set of assumptions which differ from traditional analytical perspectives. In particular, we begin from the position that that real-world baseline is not always an appropriate point of comparison for new media technologies; that a set of complex and intricate communicative behaviours arise over time; and that media spaces connect not only individuals, but the wider social groups of which they form part. We outline a framework based on four perspectives --- individual, interactional, communal and societal --- from which to view the behaviour of individuals and groups linked by multimedia environments. On the basis of our long-term findings, we argue for a view of media spaces which, first, focuses on a wider interpretation of media space interaction than the traditional view of person-to-person connections, and, second, emphasises emergent communicative practices, rather than looking for the transfer of face-to-face behaviours.},

These faces can be used as well-controlled, realistic and dynamic stimuli in emotion research. However, the validity of virtual facial expressions in comparison to natural emotion displays still needs to be shown for the different emotions and different age groups. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty-two healthy volunteers between the age of 20 and 60 rated pictures of natural human faces and faces of virtual characters (avatars) with respect to the expressed emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and neutral. Results indicate that virtual emotions were recognized comparable to natural ones. Recognition differences in virtual and natural faces depended on specific emotions: whereas disgust was difficult to convey with the current avatar technology, virtual sadness and fear achieved better recognition results than natural faces. Furthermore, emotion recognition rates decreased for virtual but not natural faces in participants over the age of 40. This specific age effect suggests that media exposure has an influence on emotion recognition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Virtual and natural facial displays of emotion may be equally effective. Improved technology (e.g. better modelling of the naso-labial area) may lead to even better results as compared to trained actors. Due to the ease with which virtual human faces can be animated and manipulated, validated artificial emotional expressions will be of major relevance in future research and therapeutic applications.},

Here we experimentally investigate human perception of eye contact and gaze direction in 2D and 3D, using a within-subjects design. Our results indicate that the disparity between the optical axis of the camera and the looking direction of a looker (a photographed face) should be at most 1.2° in horizontal direction, and 1.7° in vertical direction to support eye contact. Maximum tolerable offsets for the perception of eye contact are independent of (monoscopic or stereoscopic) display conditions. Asymmetric sensitivity to eye contact is explained by the underestimation of the vertical component of a looker's gaze direction.},

The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the potential impact of one critical design aspect of meetings -- namely, whether a decision to be taken (or the meeting in general) was scheduled or not -- on the use of distributed information, information elaboration, conflict, speed of decision making, and, ultimately, decision-making effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach-- The research presented in this paper combines a literature review with empirical data obtained from questionnaires and direct observation of decision making meetings on organisational issues in a hospital. One meeting was scheduled, the other two were unscheduled. A second questionnaire was administered 12 months after the respective decision making meetings to explore and evaluate the efficiency of the decisions made and their implementation. Findings-- This paper suggests that a scheduled meeting with a shared agenda of all decisions to be taken may induce decision makers to form opinions upfront at the meeting, with these opinions eventually serving as sources of conflict during group discussion. Because of the nature of the conflict generated, these meetings are more likely to run long and to not deliver the expected outcomes. Originality/value-- The study contributes to the debate on group decision-making processes by examining the effect of meeting scheduling on information elaboration and conflict in real-world decision-making settings. Although robust evidence has supported the existence of relationships between information elaboration, conflict, and decision-making effectiveness, previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of these processes during scheduled meetings and experimental settings. The findings of the present study show the effect of meeting scheduling on decision-making effectiveness in real-world settings.},

As two dynamic viewing slits are created at the viewer's position, the slits can track the position of the eyes by rotating the screen. The display allows a viewer to move approximately 700 mm along the horizontal axis, and 500 mm along the vertical axis with an average crosstalk below 5 \%. Two screen prototypes with different diffusers have been tried, and they provide luminance levels of 60 Cd/m2, and 160 Cd/m2 within the viewing field.},

Specifically, the system integrates continuous visual odometry computation with tracking-by-detection in order to track pedestrians in spite of frequent occlusions and egomotion of the camera rig. To achieve reliable performance under real-world conditions, it has long been advocated to extract and combine as much visual information as possible. We propose a way to closely integrate the vision modules for visual odometry, pedestrian detection, depth estimation, and tracking. The integration naturally leads to several cognitive feedback loops between the modules. Among others, we propose a novel feedback connection from the object detector to visual odometry which utilizes the semantic knowledge of detection to stabilize localization. Feedback loops always carry the danger that erroneous feedback from one module is amplified and causes the entire system to become instable. We therefore incorporate automatic failure detection and recovery, allowing the system to continue when a module becomes unreliable. The approach is experimentally evaluated on several long and difficult video sequences from busy inner-city locations. Our results show that the proposed integration makes it possible to deliver stable tracking performance in scenes of previously infeasible complexity.},

The system combines free viewpoint video with immersive projection technology to support nonverbal communication (NVC), including eye gaze, interpersonal distance, and facial expression. Importantly, these features can be interpreted together as people move around the simulation, maintaining a natural social distance. The application is a simulation of Mars, within which the collaborators must come to agreement over; for example, where the Rover should land and go. The first contribution is the creation of an MR system supporting contextualization of NVC. Two technological contributions are prototyping a technique to subtract a person from a background that may contain physical objects and/or moving images and a lightweight texturing method for multiview rendering, which provides balance in terms of visual and temporal quality. A practical contribution is the demonstration of pragmatic approaches to sharing space between display systems of distinct levels of immersion. A research tool contribution is a system that allows comparison of conventional authored and video-based reconstructed avatars, within an environment that encourages exploration and social interaction. Aspects of system quality, including the communication of facial expression and end-to-end latency are reported.},

Drawing on a qualitative study of informal interactions observed in photocopier rooms in three organizations, this paper builds on the work of ecological psychologist James Gibson to develop a theory of the affordances of informal interaction. The affordances of an environment are the possibilities for action called forth by it to a perceiving subject. Research on affordances has typically focused on the affordances of individual behavior. We introduce the notion of social affordances and identify the social and physical characteristics that produce the propinquity, privacy, and social designation necessary for an environment to afford informal interactions. The theory of social affordances provides a lens through which to reinterpret the conflicting results of previous studies and to reexamine the seemingly simple water-cooler around which the organization gathers.},

Although the issue of `attention getting' and its importance for interpersonal interaction is well recognized in the video-mediated communication literature there is very little empirical evidence as to the relative effectiveness of the various attributes of attention-getting signals. The objective of this study was to compare the response times and error rates of four attention-getting devices which were suitable for a particular application of video-mediated communication in the educational sector. Twelve subjects (eight female and four male), classroom instructors aged 35--55 years, participated in the study. Four attention-getting devices were tested in this experiment: a red light, a yellow rotating light, a wire hand, and a fan with ribbon streamers. Each device was tested three times in three different classrooms during an actual class with actual instructors (the subjects). A one-way analysis of variance demonstrated a significant difference in response time for the four devices with the yellow light and the metal hand being fastest. This preliminary study points out the importance of empirically testing the effectiveness of attention-getting devices of differing characteristics since, of the four devices tested here, two could be expected to elicit the most immediate response from a communication partner.},

A ?split-the-difference principle? is suggested to augment the usual theory, so as to specify the exact amount of payments to be made in an ordinary two-person bargaining situation such as the sale of a used car. The application of this principle seems satisfactory in the experiments. One experiment suggests that, in a sequence of trials in the same game situation, people tend to start near an equilibrium point and then try to find a better equilibrium, if there is one. The experiments show examples of non-optimal behavior of the bargainers when the judgment necessary to estimate the relevant payoff is obscure. A fair division of five parcels of objects among five players when each player attaches different values to the parcels is outlined and computed, and the effect of coalitions is discussed.},

It relies on a small number of geometric operations to compute a visual hull polyhedron in a single pass. Such simplicity enables the algorithm to combine the advantages of being fast, producing pixel-exact surfaces, and repeatably yield manifold and watertight polyhedra in general experimental conditions with real data, as verified with all datasets tested.

The model integrates two areas of research. One body of work posits that media use patterns are the outcome of objectively rational choices. These choices involve evaluating communication options and selecting an appropriate medium to match the communication requirements of the task. The second perspective is social information processing theory (Salancik \& Pfeffer, 1978). This approach proposes that attitudes and behaviors are partially determined by information embedded in the social context. The synthesis of these perspectives asserts that media characteristics and attitudes are in part socially constructed. Furthermore, attitudes are influenced by attributions based on observations of one's own past behavior. This model is shown to explain a wider range of existing empirical findings. Also, new propositions are derived to guide future research. This social construction model of media use has significant implications for the design, conduct, and reporting of future research in organizations.},

	abstract     = {The impact of looking into the camera during a presentation over a video link (resulting in the perception of mutual gaze) on information recall was investigated. In a face-to-face context mutual gaze has been shown to facilitate the encoding and subsequent recall of information [Fry, R., Smith, G.F., 1975. The effects of feedback and eye contact on performance of a digit-coding task. J. Soc. Psychol. 96, 145-146; Otteson, J.D., Otteson, C.R., 1980. Effect of teacher's gaze on children's story recall. Percept. Motor Skill. 50, 35-42; Sherwood, J.V., 1988. Facilitative effects of gaze upon learning. Percept. Motor Skill. 64 (3 Part 2), 1275-1278]. One explanation for these findings is that gaze acts as an arousal stimulus, which increases attentional focus and therefore enhances memory [Kelley, D.H., Gorham, J., 1988. Effects of immediacy on recall of information. Commun. Edu. 37(3), 198-207]. Two studies were conducted in order to test whether gazing at the camera during video-mediated presentations resulted in similar benefits as mutual gaze in a face-to-face context. In study 1 a confederate presented information about two fictitious soap products. In one condition, the confederate gazed at the camera for 30\% of the presentation, therefore giving the participants the impression that he was gazing in their direction. In the other condition the confederate did not gaze at the camera. Participants viewed the sales presentations from both conditions. In the condition where gaze was directed at the camera, participants recalled significantly more information about the sales presentation. Study 2 employed the same pre-recorded sales presentations used in study 1, however they were delivered to the participants under audio-only conditions (therefore, the image was switched off). Results from study 2 indicated no recall differences between the two conditions. Findings from these studies would seem to indicate that the perception of gaze aversion over a video link (a consequence of the salesman not looking into the camera) has a negative impact on information recall. This has practical implications for video-mediated presentations. In a distance learning environment lecturers could be advised to look into the camera in order to promote more efficient learning in students.},

A number of responses are investigated, including presence, copresence, and two physiological responses?heart rate and electrodermal activity (EDA). Our findings suggest that increasing agents' responsiveness even on a simple level can have a significant impact on certain aspects of people's social responses to human-oid agents. Despite being aware that the agents were computer-generated, participants with higher levels of social anxiety were significantly more likely to avoid ?disturbing? them. This suggests that on some level people can respond to virtual humans as social actors even in the absence of complex interaction. Responses appear to be shaped both by the agents' behaviors and by people's expectations of the technology. Participants experienced a significantly higher sense of personal contact when the agents were visually responsive to them, as opposed to static or simply moving. However, this effect diminished with experienced computer users. Our preliminary analysis of objective heart-rate data reveals an identical pattern of responses.},

However, we advance beyond the state-of-the-art improving over previous attempts of ``in-frame'' geometric compression on 3D structures inferred from generic OpenGL command sequences and adding ``inter-frame'' redundancy exploitation of the traffic generated by the typical architecture of interactive applications. Measurements reveal for this combination of techniques a very effective reduction of network traffic and a CPU overhead compatible with the requirements of interactive applications, suggesting a significant application potential for Internet-based 3D content streaming.},

As an alternative to existing linguistic approaches for the automatic analysis of conversations, a relatively recent domain is using findings in social cognition, social psychology, and communication that have established the key role that nonverbal communication plays in the formation, maintenance, and evolution of a number of fundamental social constructs, which emerge from face-to-face interactions in time scales that range from short glimpses all the way to long-term encounters. Small group conversations are a specific case on which much of this work has been conducted. This paper reviews the existing literature on automatic analysis of small group conversations using nonverbal communication, and aims at bridging the current fragmentation of the work in this domain, currently split among half a dozen technical communities. The review is organized around the main themes studied in the literature and discusses, in a comparative fashion, about 100 works addressing problems related to the computational modeling of interaction management, internal states, personality traits, and social relationships in small group conversations, along with pointers to the relevant literature in social science. Some of the many open challenges and opportunities in this domain are also discussed.},

But what purpose, if any, does gesture serve? In this review, I begin by examining gesture when it stands on its own, substituting for speech and clearly serving a communicative function. When called upon to carry the full burden of communication, gesture assumes a language-like form, with structure at word and sentence levels. However, when produced along with speech, gesture assumes a different form - it becomes imagistic and analog. Despite its form, the gesture that accompanies speech also communicates. Trained coders can glean substantive information from gesture - information that is not always identical to that gleaned from speech. Gesture can thus serve as a research tool, shedding light on speakers' unspoken thoughts. The controversial question is whether gesture conveys information to listeners not trained to read them. Do spontaneous gestures communicate to ordinary listeners? Or might they be produced only for speakers themselves? I suggest these are not mutually exclusive functions - gesture serves as both a tool for communication for listeners, and a tool for thinking for speakers.},

In this paper it will be suggested that a primordial site for the analysis of human language, cognition, and action consists of a situation in which multiple participants are attempting to carry out courses of action in concert with each other through talk while attending to both the larger activities that their current actions are ambedded within, and relevant phenomena in their surround. Using as data video recordings of young girls playing hopscotch and archaeologists classifying color, it will be argued that human action is built throught the simultaneous deployment of a range of quite different kinds of semiotic resources. Talk itself contains multiple sign systems with alternative properties. Strips of talk gain their power as social action via their placement within larger sequential structures, encompassing activities, and participation frameworks constituted through displays of mutual orientation made by the actors' bodies. The body is used in a quite different way to perform gesture, again a class of phenomena that encompasses structurally different types of sign systems. Both talk and gesture can index, construe or treat as irrelevant, entities in the participants' surround. Moreover, material structure in the surround, such as graphic fields of various types, can provide semiotic structure without which the constitution of particular kinds of action being invoked through talk would be impossible. In brief it will be argued that the construction of action through talk within situated interaction is accomplished through the temporally unfolding juxtaposition of quite different kinds of semiotic resources, and that moreover through this process the human body is made publicly visible as the site for a range of structurally different kinds of displays implicated in the constitution of the actions of the moment.},

This allows generation of novel views of actions from any angle and is of interest for visualisation in TV productions. The system utilises 3D reconstruction techniques previously developed for studio use. This paper discusses some experiences found while applying these techniques for an uncontrolled outdoor environment and addresses robustness issues. This includes segmentation, camera calibration and 3D reconstruction. A number of different 3D representations, including billboards, visual hulls and view-dependent geometry are evaluated for the purpose.},

This platform enables users to view photos (e.g., family or holiday snapshots) together, while the presenter and the viewer are at different, remote locations. The platform includes a common viewing space where the photos are displayed and selected, as well as an audio connection and a large-screen video connection for communication between the remote sites. The study investigated the effects of videocommunication on social presence. In addition, the ability to point at a picture with an electronic pointer was evaluated. In the context of presence research, the current study also provided information regarding the validity of the IPO Social Presence Questionnaire (IPO-SPQ), which was specifically designed to investigate social presence with telecommunication applications. The results indicated that adding broadband, life-size video communication significantly increased social presence. In addition, we found a significant effect of sex on social presence: women gave substantially higher social presence ratings than men. The absence of a significant effect of the pointing function indicated that extensive workspace functionality may be of minor importance to the user's feeling of social presence.},

However, running such trials in a real setting and making sure that the application and networking infrastructures will be stable enough is still a challenge. In this paper, we describe some of our experiences, together with the technical choices that have permitted many hours of successful Internet trials. We also make a thorough analysis of different correlated logging data. This analysis allows us to propose and confirm a model of a CVE application's network behavior, together with a number of interesting results that disprove some common assumptions. Furthermore, we use the model and the logging data to highlight the benefits of IP multicasting and for predicting traffic behaviors and bandwidth use on top of different logical network topologies.},

Despite the importance of theory, questions relating to its form and structure are neglected in comparison with questions relating to epistemology. The essay addresses issues of causality, explanation, prediction, and generalization that underlie an understanding of theory. A taxonomy is proposed that classifies information systems theories with respect to the manner in which four central goals are addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction, and prescription. Five interrelated types of theory are distinguished: (1) theory for analyzing, (2) theory for explaining, (3) theory for predicting, (4) theory for explaining and predicting, and (5) theory for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature of each theory type. The applicability of the taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying a sample of journal articles. The paper contributes by showing that multiple views of theory exist and by exposing the assumptions underlying different viewpoints. In addition, it is suggested that the type of theory under development can influence the choice of an epistemological approach. Support is given for the legitimacy and value of each theory type. The building of integrated bodies of theory that encompass all theory types is advocated.]},

The stepwise regression analysis converged on a three?predictor model revealing that social presence (the degree to which a person is perceived as ?real? in mediated communication), student perception of having equal opportunity to participate, and technical skills accounted for about 68\% of the explained variance. Social presence alone contributed about 60\% of this variance, suggesting that it may be a very strong predictor of satisfaction. Reliability data on the social presence scale is provided. The results also indicated that participants who felt a higher sense of social presence enhanced their socio?emotional experience by using emoticons to express missing nonverbal cues in written form. These findings have implications for designing academic computer conferences where equal attention must be paid to designing techniques that enhance social presence.},

Photographs and live portrayals produced comparable results. Every observer was able to label the expressions accurately although accuracy declined as distance increased. Extrapolation from the data suggested that some messages may be sent far beyond the distances used in this study.

The intent of our research is to learn whether there are elements in existing group communication patterns that suggest how future communication systems can be designed or selected to fit the actual work relationships of a group. A detailed social network survey provided information about what members of the group communicated about, how they communicated, and with whom they communicated. Most communication was done through a combination of media, but predominately through unscheduled encounters, electronic mail, and scheduled meetings; people rarely videoconferenced, telephoned, or faxed. Factor analysis reduced the 24 work relationships to six distinct dimensions: receiving work, giving work, collaborative writing, major emotional support, sociability, and computer programming. The proportion in which the three main media were used varied according to the nature of the work dimension. Our findings suggest that a multivariate perspective that considers group norms and practices, social networks, and work dimensions is necessary to analyze media use.},

While considerable work has been done to examine interaction in desktop-based collaborative virtual environments (CVEs), there are currently no studies for collaborative interaction using IPTs. The aim of this paper is to examine how immersive technologies support interaction and to compare this to the experience with desktop systems. A study of collaboration is presented where two partners worked together using networked IPT environments. The data collected included observations, analysis of video and audio recordings, questionnaires and debriefing interviews from both IPT sites. This paper focuses on the successes and failures in collaboration through detailed examination of particular incidents during the interaction. We compare these successes and failures with the findings of a study by Hindmarsh, Fraser, Heath, \& Benford (Computer Supported Collaborative Work, CSCW'98, 1998, pp. 217?226) that examined object-focused interaction on a desktop-based CVE system. Our findings identify situations where interaction is better supported with the IPT system than the desktop system, and situations where interaction is not as well supported. We also present examples of how social interaction is critical to seamless collaboration.},

Distributions of pause, gap and overlap durations in conversations are presented, and methodological issues regarding the statistical treatment of such distributions are discussed. The results are related to published minimal response times for spoken utterances and thresholds for detection of acoustic silences in speech. It is shown that turn-taking is generally less precise than is often claimed by researchers in the field of conversation analysis or interactional linguistics. These results are discussed in the light of their implications for models of timing in turn-taking, and for interaction control models in speech technology. In particular, it is argued that the proportion of speaker changes that could potentially be triggered by information immediately preceding the speaker change is large enough for reactive interaction controls models to be viable in speech technology.},

We measured the execution time of the CUDA version compared to the fastest available CPU. The CUDA implementation includes a loop re-ordering and an optimized memory allocation, which improves even more the performance of the reconstruction on the GPUs.},

Model-based reconstruction of shape from silhouettes is used to transform a standard 3D generic humanoid model to approximate a person's shape and anatomical structure. Realistic appearance is achieved by colour texture mapping from the multiview images. The results show the reconstruction of a realistic 3D facsimile of the person suitable for animation in a virtual world. The system is inexpensive and is reliable for large variations in shape, size and clothing. This is the first approach to achieve realistic model capture for clothed people and automatic reconstruction of animated models. A commercial system based on this approach has recently been used to capture thousands of models of the general public.},

Females were faster than males at naming male faces, and males were faster than females at naming female faces.

The question is whether these gestures merely precede language development or are fundamentally tied to it.

First, a great many of the lexical items that each child produced initially in gesture later moved to that child's verbal lexicon. Second, children who were first to produce gesture-plus-word combinations conveying two elements in a proposition (point at bird and say ``nap'') were also first to produce two-word combinations (``bird nap''). Changes in gesture thus not only predate but also predict changes in language, suggesting that early gesture may be paving the way for future developments in language.},

A networked workstation technology and electronic blackboard technology were contrasted with their conventional counterparts. Twenty-one software designers, assigned to three teams, performed team tasks that involved generating ideas and reaching consensus. Positive effects on the thoroughness of information exchange and quality of team performance were found in the meetings in which electronic blackboard technology was available. The networked workstations provided mixed results. Significant team differences were found in performance and interaction measures. The results and their implications are discussed in terms of the necessary future developments and nature of future research in computer-based meeting support technology.]},

Both internal (mental) and external (physical or digital) representations are considered. It is discovered that both types of representation are deeply linked to thought processes. They are linked to learning, the ability to use existing knowledge, and problem solving strategies. The links between representations, thought processes, and behavior are so deep that even eye movements are partly governed by representations. Choice of representations can affect limited cognitive resources like attention and short-term memory by forcing a person to try to utilize poorly organized information or perform `translations' from one representation to another. The implications of this evidence are discussed. Based on these findings, a set of guidelines are presented, for digital representations which minimize drain of cognitive resources. These guidelines describe what sorts of characteristics and behaviors a representation should exhibit, and what sorts of information it should contain in order to accommodate and facilitate design. Current attempts to implement such representations are discussed.},

The aim of this survey is to review the literature on affective body expression perception and recognition. One issue is whether there are universal aspects to affect expression perception and recognition models or if they are affected by human factors such as culture. Next, we discuss the difference between form and movement information as studies have shown that they are governed by separate pathways in the brain. We also review psychological studies that have investigated bodily configurations to evaluate if specific features can be identified that contribute to the recognition of specific affective states. The survey then turns to automatic affect recognition systems using body expressions as at least one input modality. The survey ends by raising open questions on data collecting, labeling, modeling, and setting benchmarks for comparing automatic recognition systems.},

These solutions are organized into three broad categories based on whether the solutions assume egoistic actors and whether the structure of the situation can be changed: Motivational solutions assume actors are not completely egoistic and so give some weight to the outcomes of their partners. Strategic solutions assume egoistic actors, and neither of these categories of solutions involve changing the fundamental structure of the situation. Solutions that do involve changing the rules of the game are considered in the section on structural solutions. I conclude the review with a discussion of current research and directions for future work.},

The primary function of conversational hand gestures is to aid in the formulation of speech. Gestures can convey nonsemantic information. The study of speech and gestures overlaps with the study of person perception and attribution processes. The significance of gestures can be ambiguous and will affect the meanings and consequences to the observed gestures. A topology of gestures is adopters, symbolic gestures, and conversational gestures. Different types of conversational gestures can be distinguished as---namely, motor movements and lexical movements. Conversational hand gestures have been assumed to convey semantic information. Several studies that attempt to assess the kinds of information conversational gestures convey to naive observers and the extent to which gestures enhance the communicativeness of spoken messages are described in the chapter.},

In this paper, an overview of the various systems, application areas, and challenges found in the literature concerning mobile robotic telepresence is provided. The survey also proposes a set terminology for the field as there is currently a lack of standard terms for the different concepts related to MRP systems. Further, this paper provides an outlook on the various research directions for developing and enhancing mobile robotic telepresence systems per se, as well as evaluating the interaction in laboratory and field settings. Finally, the survey outlines a number of design implications for the future of mobile robotic telepresence systems for social interaction.},

Furthermore, we discuss bandwidth issues of differential update coding for 3D video. In our telepresence system-the blue-c-we use a point-based 3D video technology which allows for differentially encoded 3D representations of human users. While we discuss the considerations which lead to the design of our three-stage 3D video pipeline, we also elucidate some critical implementation details regarding decoupling of acquisition, processing and rendering frame rates, and audio/video synchronization. Finally, we demonstrate the communication and networking features of the blue-c system in its full deployment. We show how the system can possibly be controlled to face processing or networking bottlenecks by adapting the multiple system components like audio, application data, and 3D video.},

A Stroop-type interference paradigm was adopted, in which gaze and head cues were placed into conflict. In separate blocks of trials, participants were asked to make speeded keypress responses contingent on either the direction of gaze, or the orientation of the head displayed in a digitized photograph of a male face. In Experiments 1 and 2, head and gaze cues showed symmetrical interference effects. Compared with congruent arrangements, incongruent head cues slowed responses to gaze cues, and incongruent gaze cues slowed responses to head cues, suggesting that head and gaze are mutually influential in the analysis of social attention direction. This mutuality was also evident in a cross-modal version of the task (Experiment 3) where participants responded to spoken directional words whilst ignoring the head/gaze images. It is argued that these interference effects arise from the independent influences of gaze and head orientation on decisions concerning social attention direction.},

In general, identifying a nonconvex object using a silhouette-based approach implies neglecting some features of its surface as identification clues. The same features cannot be reconstructed by volume intersection techniques using multiple silhouettes of the object. This paper addresses the problem of finding which parts of a nonconvex object are relevant for silhouette-based image understanding. For this purpose, the geometric concept of visual hull of a 3-D object is introduced. This is the closest approximation of object S that can be obtained with the volume intersection approach; it is the maximal object silhouette-equivalent to S, i.e., which can be substituted for S without affecting any silhouette. Only the parts of the surface of S that also lie on the surface of the visual hull can be reconstructed or identified using silhouette-based algorithms. The visual hull depends not only on the object but also on the region allowed to the viewpoint. Two main viewing regions result in the external and internal visual hull. In the former case the viewing region is related to the convex hull of S, in the latter it is bounded by S. The internal visual hull also admits an interpretation not related to silhouettes. Algorithms for computing visual hulls are presented and their complexity analyzed. In general, the visual hull of a 3-D planar face object turns out to be bounded by planar and curved patches.},

First of all, the feature points on the head in the head-centered coordinate system and their image projections are used to determine a transformation matrix. Then, the camera position and orientations are extracted from the matrix. Finally, the 3D coordinates of the head points expressed in the camera-centered coordinate system are obtained. Starting from the coordinates of the neck, which is a head feature point, the 3D coordinates of other joints one-by-one are determined under the assumption of the fixed lengths of the body segments. A binary interpretation tree is used to represent the 2n − 1 possible body structures, if a human body has n joints. To determine the final feasible body structures, physical and motion constraints are used to prune the interpretation tree. Formulas and rules required for the tree pruning are formulated. Experiments are used to illustrate the pruning powers of these constraints. In the two cases of input data chosen, a unique or nearly unique solution of the body structure is obtained.},

The system optimizes alignment with regard to initial user position, free shared floor space, camera positioning and other factors. Thus we can reduce discrepancies between different room and furniture layouts without actually modifying the rooms themselves. A description and discussion of our alignment scheme is given along with an exemplary implementation on real-world datasets.},

The ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI) is a new state questionnaire measure whose development has been informed by previous research on the determinants of presence and current self-report measures. It focuses on users' experiences of media, with no reference to objective system parameters. More than 600 people completed the ITC-SOPI following an experience with one of a range of noninteractive and interactive media. Exploratory analysis (principal axis factoring) revealed four factors: Sense of Physical Space, Engagement, Ecological Validity, and Negative Effects. Relations between the factors and the consistency of the factor structure with others reported in the literature are discussed. Preliminary analyses described here demonstrate that the ITC-SOPI is reliable and valid, but more rigorous testing of its psychometric properties and applicability to interactive virtual environments is required. Subject to satisfactory confirmatory analyses, the ITC-SOPI will offer researchers using a range of media systems a tool with which to measure four facets of a media experience that are putatively related to presence.},

The dandelion model is composed of a pencil of organized line segments emitted from a common point which samples the bounding hull surface in regularly distributed orientations with the ending points serving as sampling points. The orientations and the topology of the line segments are derived from a geodesic sphere. The lengths of the line segments are computed by cutting rays in 2D with silhouette outlines. Based on the subdivision structure of the geodesic sphere, the sampling resolution can be refined adaptively until the desired precision is achieved. Finally a manifold mesh is extracted from the dandelion model.},

On average, judgments of head orientation were reliable even out to the extremes of peripheral vision (90 degrees eccentricity), with better performance at the extremes when the participant was able to view the looker changing head orientation from one trial to the next. In sharp contrast, judgments of eye-gaze direction were reliable only out to 4 degrees eccentricity, signifying that the eye-gaze social signal is available to people only when they fixate near the looker's eyes. While not unexpected, this vast difference in availability of information about head direction and eye direction, both of which can serve as indicators of the looker's focus of attention, is important for understanding the dynamics of eye-gaze behavior.},

It was anticipated that gaze direction would moderate the efficiency of the mental operations through which these social-cognitive products are generated. Specifically, eye gaze was expected to influence both the speed with which targets could be categorized as men and women and the rate at which associated stereotypic material could be accessed from semantic memory. The results of two experiments supported these predictions: Targets with nondeviated (i.e., direct) eye gaze elicited facilitated categorical responses.

Extending work of this kind, the present research investigated the effects of eye gaze on basic aspects of the person-perception process, namely, person construal and the extraction of category-related knowledge from semantic memory. It was anticipated that gaze direction would moderate the efficiency of the mental operations through which these social-cognitive products are generated. Specifically, eye gaze was expected to influence both the speed with which targets could be categorized as men and women and the rate at which associated stereotypic material could be accessed from semantic memory. The results of two experiments supported these predictions: Targets with nondeviated (i.e., direct) eye gaze elicited facilitated categorical responses. The implications of these findings for recent treatments of person perception are considered.},

Novel contributions include an algorithm for merging data between multiple depth cameras and techniques for automatic color calibration and preserving stereo quality even with low rendering rates. Also presented is a solution to the problem of interference that occurs between Kinect cameras with overlapping views. Emphasis is placed on a fully GPU-accelerated data processing and rendering pipeline that can apply hole filling, smoothing, data merger, surface generation, and color correction at rates of up to 100 million triangles/sec on a single PC and graphics board. Also presented is a Kinect-based marker-less tracking system that combines 2D eye recognition with depth information to allow head-tracked stereo views to be rendered for a parallax barrier autostereoscopic display. Our system is affordable and reproducible, offering the opportunity to easily deliver 3D telepresence beyond the researcher's lab.},

This paper first proposes a parallel pipeline processing method for reconstructing a dynamic 3-D object shape from multiview video images, by which a temporal series of full 3-D voxel representations of the object behavior can be obtained in real time. To realize the real-time processing, we first introduce a plane-based volume intersection algorithm: first represent an observable 3-D space by a group of parallel plane slices, then back-project observed multiview object silhouettes onto each slice, and finally apply two-dimensional silhouette intersection on each slice. Then, we propose a method to parallelize this algorithm using a PC cluster, where we employ five-stage pipeline processing in each PC as well as slice-by-slice parallel silhouette intersection. Several results of the quantitative performance evaluation are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In the latter half of the paper, we present an algorithm of generating video texture on the reconstructed dynamic 3-D object surface. We first describe a naive view-independent rendering method and show its problems. Then, we improve the method by introducing image-based rendering techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved method in generating high fidelity object images from arbitrary viewpoints.},

A practical and accurate technique for solving this problem from profiles alone is developed. It is precise enough to reconstruct the shape of the object. No correspondences between points or lines are necessary. Symmetry of the surface of revolution swept out by the rotating object is exploited to obtain the image of the rotation axis and the homography relating epipolar lines in two views robustly and elegantly. These, together with geometric constraints for images of rotating objects, are used to obtain first the image of the horizon, which is the projection of the plane that contains the camera centers, and then the epipoles, thus fully determining the epipolar geometry of the image sequence. The estimation of this geometry by this sequential approach avoids many of the problems found in other algorithms. The search for the epipoles, by far the most critical step, is carried out as a simple 1D optimization. Parameter initialization is trivial and completely automatic at all stages. After the estimation of the epipolar geometry, the Euclidean motion is recovered using the fixed intrinsic parameters of the camera obtained either from a calibration grid or from self-calibration techniques. Finally, the spinning object is reconstructed from its profiles using the motion estimated in the previous stage. Results from real data are presented, demonstrating the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed methods.},

To this end, we propose trainable behavioral models that predict the optimal actions for one specific person given others' perceived actions and the joint goals of the interlocutors. We first compare sequential models---in particular discrete hidden Markov models (DHMMs)---with standard classifiers (SVMs and decision trees). We propose a modification of the initialization of the DHMMs in order to better capture the recurrent structure of the sensory-motor states. We show that the explicit state duration modeling by discrete hidden semi markov models (DHSMMs) improves prediction performance. We applied these models to parallel speech and gaze data collected from interacting dyads. The challenge was to predict the gaze of one subject given the gaze of the interlocutor and the voice activity of both. For both DHMMs and DHSMMs the short-time Viterbi concept is used for incremental decoding and prediction. For the proposed models we evaluated objectively several properties in order to go beyond pure classification performance. Results show that incremental DHMMs (IDHMMs) were more efficient than classic classifiers and superseded by incremental DHSMMs (IDHSMMs). This later result emphasizes the relevance of state duration modeling.},

An experiment is reported in which pairs complete a communication task using a novel apparatus that supports full gaze awareness (GA) and mutual gaze (eye contact). This ``GA display'' was contrasted with 2 control conditions, mutual gaze without full gaze awareness and audio only. The GA display reduced the number of turns and number of words required to complete the task by about 1/2 in comparison with the 2 control conditions. The results of a subsequent conversational games analysis suggest that at least part of this saving comes about because full gaze awareness provides an alternative nonlinguistic channel for checking one's own and the other person's understanding of what was said.},

Live reconstruction of the human form, from cameras surrounding the subject, could bridge the gap between video conferencing and Immersive Collaborative Virtual Environments (ICVEs). Video conferencing faithfully reproduces what someone looks like whereas ICVE faithfully reproduces what they look at. While 3D video has been demonstrated in tele-immersion prototypes, the visual/temporal quality has been way below what has become acceptable in video conferencing. Managed synchronization of the acquisition stage is universally used today to ensure multiple images feeding the reconstruction algorithm were taken at the same time. However, this inevitably increases latency and jitter. We measure the temporal characteristics of the capture stage and the impact of inconsistency on the reconstruction algorithm this feeds. This gives us both input and output characteristics for synchronization. From this we determine whether frame synchronization of multiple camera video streams actually needs to be delivered for 3D reconstruction, and if not what level of temporal divergence is acceptable across the captured image frames.},

In a shape-from-silhouette based system, images are captured at the same moment to ensure the position of the object is consistent in all frames. Differences in position between captured frames results in deformations such as holes and missing or extended features. By capturing images of a projected clock, we can tell with around 10ms granularity, how closely together images are captured. This gives us an indication of whether software capture triggers delivered over a network can be used for image acquisition in a 3D reconstruction system, instead of hardware synchronised capture.},

Video conferencing either does not attempt to support eye gaze (e.g. AcessGrid) or only approximates it in round table conditions (e.g. life size telepresence). Immersive collaborative virtual environments represent remote participants through avatars that follow their tracked movements. By additionally tracking people's eyes and representing their movement on their avatars, the line of gaze can be faithfully reproduced, as opposed to approximated. This paper presents the results of initial work that tested if the focus of gaze could be more accurately gauged if tracked eye movement was added to that of the head of an avatar observed in an immersive VE. An experiment was conducted to assess the difference between user's abilities to judge what objects an avatar is looking at with only head movements being displayed, while the eyes remained static, and with eye gaze and head movement information being displayed. The results from the experiment show that eye gaze is of vital importance to the subjects correctly identifying what a person is looking at in an immersive virtual environment. This is followed by a description of the work that is now being undertaken following the positive results from the experiment. We discuss the integration of an eye tracker more suitable for immersive mobile use and the software and techniques that were developed to integrate the user's real-world eye movements into calibrated eye gaze in an immersive virtual world. This is to be used in the creation of an immersive collaborative virtual environment supporting eye gaze and its ongoing experiments. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Results revealed, among other things, that stereoscopy increases telepresence and makes videoconferencing more attractive. In addition, we found that reduced eye contact angles enhance the recognizability of individually addressed nonverbal signals. However, a setup that eliminates horizontal and vertical eye contact angles seems to be advantageous only in conferences with more than two persons per site.},

After two years of work, we are presenting the main features of our approach and results, our driving applications, the main components of our technical investigations, and our experimental activities. With different citizen and professional application scenarios as driving forces, COVEN is exploring the requirements and supporting techniques for collaborative interaction in scalable CVEs. Technical results are being integrated in an enriched networked VR platform based on the dVS and DIVE systems. Taking advantage of a dedicated Europe-wide ISDN and ATM network infrastructure, a large component of the project is a trial and experimentation activity that should allow a comprehensive understanding of the network requirements of these systems as well as their usability issues and human factors aspects.},

Perceived agency was manipulated by telling the participants that the image was either an avatar controlled by a human, or an agent controlled by a computer. The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computer-controlled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases tele-presence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those interacting with partners represented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.},

In real world business situations, people pull up a chair after catching the eye of someone already seated. Telethrone is a situated display on a chair which allows multiple correct views of a remote collaborator. The system has been expanded to support informal meetings where chairs can be moved around. This is facilitated through the novel integration of a 3D reconstructed model of a person, with live viewpoint dependent rendering onto a retro-reflective surface. This removes the need for painstaking alignment of multiple cameras and projectors each time a chair is moved. A between subjects experiment tested accuracy of reconnected mutual gaze mediated by part of the system. Subjectively easier and harder situations are compared. Specifically best and worst cases, both in terms of orientation of eyes in the reconstructed head, and angle of observer gaze onto the display. Discussion compares results to experiments that used other systems to attempt to convey eye gaze by different techniques. This research builds toward a scalable system for ad hoc business meetings; a paradigm poorly supported by current video conferencing. It is also applicable to supporting conversations between seated people in any scenario where seats might be moved, for example in interaction between client and therapist in tele-therapy.},

The facial expressions has been considered as the most significant factor in tele-communications, such as tele-services. To realize the real time facial expression transportation system, we propose the facial expression space (FES) and a correspondence technique between each personal facial expression spaces. Then, real time facial expression transportation system is developed, which transports the facial expression but not the image itself. This final system is able to display the same facial expressions in another person and further more in cartoon characters. The experimental results show the validity of these criteria.},

Matching is performed simply by computing the sum of squared-difference (SSD) values. The SSD functions for individual stereo pairs are represented with respect to the inverse distance and are then added to produce the sum of SSDs. This resulting function is called the SSSD-in-inverse-distance. It is shown that the SSSD-in-inverse-distance function exhibits a unique and clear minimum at the correct matching position, even when the underlying intensity patterns of the scene include ambiguities or repetitive patterns. The authors first define a stereo algorithm based on the SSSD-in-inverse-distance and present a mathematical analysis to show how the algorithm can remove ambiguity and increase precision. Experimental results with real stereo images are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

We consider independent and explanatory variables including whether the participant is the centre of attention in the scenario, whether the participant is shy or confident, and his relationship status. We also examine whether this interaction between the participant and the virtual character changes as the conversation progresses. The results show that the participants tend to have different hand movements, head movements, and posture depending on these conditions. This research therefore provides strong evidence for using body movement as a systematic method to assess the responses of people within a virtual environment, especially when the participant interacts with a virtual character. These results also point the way towards the application of this technology to the treatment of social phobic males.},

Following the Hawthorne studies, various explanations have been proposed to account for rising rates of production. Although in the Relay Assembly Test Room experiment the experimental operations may have produced other extraneous variables, a reexamination based on new and neglected evidence has yielded a new interpretation. The new variable, made more plausible because research in other contexts has shown it to have similar effects, is a combination of information feedback and financial reward. It is an example of the control of behavior by its consequences. Although several approaches may be taken to explain the effects of response-consequence contingencies, I have favored operant conditioning because it seems to account for progressive increases in response rate-the Hawthorne phenomenon. Generalizing from the particular situation at Hawthorne, I would define the Hawthorne effect as the confounding that occurs if experimenters fail to realize how the consequences of subjects' performance affect what subjects do. But the Hawthorne effect need not be viewed solely as a problem in conducting experiments. The phenomenon that created it should be studied in its own right, as Sommer (67) suggested with a different phenomenon in mind. The study of response-consequence contingencies might well be extended to the examination of motivation in industrial workers.},

The importance of secure and rapid communication between the nodes is also stressed and an example implemented solution is described.

The 3D shape information is also used to compute collisions and reaction forces with virtual objects, enforcing the mechanical presence of the user in the virtual world. The innovation is a fully integrated system with both immersive and interactive capabilities. It embeds a parallel version of the EPVH modeling algorithm inside a distributed vision pipeline. It also adopts the hierarchical component approach of the FlowVR middleware to enforce software modularity and enable distributed executions. Results show high refresh rates and low latencies obtained by taking advantage of the I/O and computing resources of PC clusters. The applications we have developed demonstrate the quality of the visual and mechanical presence with a single platform and with a dual platform that allows telecollaboration.},

We exploit the mirror symmetry property and derive a common homography that relates silhouettes with epipoles under circular motion. With the epipoles determined, the homography can be computed from the frontier points induced by epipolar tangencies. On the other hand, given the homography, the epipoles can be located directly from the bi-tangent lines of silhouettes. With the homography recovered, the image invariants under circular motion and camera parameters can be determined. If the epipoles are not available, camera parameters can be determined by a low-dimensional search of the optimal homography in a bounded region. In the degenerate case, when the camera optical axes intersect at one point, we derive a closed-form solution for the focal length to solve the problem. By using the proposed algorithm, we can achieve camera calibration simply from silhouettes of three images captured under circular motion. Experimental results on synthetic and real images are presented to show its performance.},

Then using this calibrated system, and again just from the silhouette cues, we introduce a probabilistic sensor fusion framework for 3D dynamic, scene reconstruction with potential static obstacles. Several real-world data sets show that despite lighting variation, photometric inconsistency between views, shadows, reflections, and so forth, not only are densely cluttered dynamic objects reconstructed and tracked, but static obstacles in the scene are also recovered.},

Participants viewed disgusting, sad, frightening, happy, and neutral images, responding to each with a genuine or deceptive (simulated, neutralized, or masked) expression. Each 1/30-s frame (104,550 frames in 697 expressions) was analyzed for the presence and duration of universal expressions, microexpressions, and blink rate. Relative to genuine emotions, masked emotions were associated with more inconsistent expressions and an elevated blink rate; neutralized emotions showed a decreased blink rate. Negative emotions were more difficult to falsify than happiness. Although untrained observers performed only slightly above chance at detecting deception, inconsistent emotional leakage occurred in 100\% of participants at least once and lasted longer than the current definition of a microexpression suggests. Microexpressions were exhibited by 21.95\% of participants in 2\% of all expressions, and in the upper or lower face only.},

To inform this debate we present an analysis into the role of skill in the performance of online poker players, using a large database with hundreds of millions of player-hand observations from real money ring games at three different stakes levels. We find that players whose earlier profitability was in the top (bottom) deciles perform better (worse) and are substantially more likely to end up in the top (bottom) performance deciles of the following time period. Regression analyses of performance on historical performance and other skill-related proxies provide further evidence for persistence and predictability. Simulations point out that skill dominates chance when performance is measured over 1,500 or more hands of play.},

Typically, these techniques depend on view-dependent texture mapping to render the textured 3D models in which the texture of novel views is synthesized at runtime according to different view-points. This is computationally expensive and limits their application in domains where efficient computations are required, such as games and virtual reality. In this paper we present an offline technique for creating view-independent texture atlases for 3D models, given a set of registered images. The best texture map resolution is computed by considering the areas of the projected polygons in the images. Texture maps are generated by a weighted composition of all available image information in the scene.Assuming that all surfaces of the model are exhibiting Lambertian reflectance properties, ray-tracing is then employed, for creating the view-independent texture maps. Finally, all the generated texture maps are packed into texture atlases. The result is a 3D model with an associated view-independent texture atlas which can be used efficiently in any application without any knowledge of camera pose information.},

Therefore, the positions in physical world can be detected by acquiring the pen-point coordinate within the single marker coordinate system. As the markers-based image segmentation for a small region is swift, the process is a real-time. The experimental result indicates that it is able to pick-up points steadily. In addition, the system is easy and quite convenient to operate. So it has good potential in 3D interaction design.},

To answer these questions, we examined 628 papers published between 1995 and 1999 in 13 leading research journals in the CS field. Our results suggest that while CS research examines a variety of technical topics it is relatively focused in terms of the level at which research is conducted as well as the research techniques used. Further, CS research seldom relies on work outside the discipline for its theoretical foundations. We present our findings as an evaluation of the state of current research and as groundwork for future CS research efforts.},

It is used in a variety of application scenarios with a wide range of coordination needs and efforts, such as private chat, discussion meetings, and negotiation tasks. In particular, in scenarios requiring certain levels of trust and judgement non-verbal communication, cues are highly important for effective communication. Mutual gaze support plays a central role in those high coordination need scenarios but generally lacks adequate technical support from videoconferencing systems. In this paper, we review technical concepts and implementations for mutual gaze support in videoconferencing, classify them, evaluate them according to a defined set of criteria, and give recommendations for future developments. Our review gives decision makers, researchers, and developers a tool to systematically apply and further develop videoconferencing systems in ``serious'' settings requiring mutual gaze. This should lead to well-informed decisions regarding the use and development of this technology and to a more widespread exploitation of the benefits of videoconferencing in general. For example, if videoconferencing systems supported high-quality mutual gaze in an easy-to-set-up and easy-to-use way, we could hold more effective and efficient recruitment interviews, court hearings, or contract negotiations.},

The paper outlines the unique design challenges, features, implementation and evaluation of CubIT. The system was built to make the Cube facility accessible to QUT's academic and student population. CubIT enables users to easily upload and share their own media content, and allows multiple users to simultaneously interact with the Cube's wall displays. The features of CubIT are implemented via three user interfaces, a multi-touch interface working on the wall displays, a mobile phone and tablet application and a web-based content management system. Each of these interfaces offers different interaction mechanisms. Together they support a wide range of collaborative features including multi-user shared workspaces, drag and drop upload and sharing between users, session management and dynamic state control between different parts of the system. The results of our evaluation study showed that CubIT was successfully used for a variety of tasks, but also highlighted specific challenges with regards to user expectations as well as issues arising from public use.},

The paradigm scales naturally to multiple viewers, allowing for scenarios where an instructor and multiple students are involved in the training. We have developed a physical-virtual patient for medical students to conduct ophthalmic exams, in an interactive training experience. In this experience, the trainee practices multiple skills simultaneously, including using a surrogate optical instrument in front of a physical head, conversing with the patient about his fears, observing realistic head motion, and practicing patient safety.

Collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) allow distributed teams to come together across distance to share a task. Studies of CVE systems have tended to focus on the sense of presence or copresence with other people. They have avoided studying close interaction between us-ers, such as the shared manipulation of objects, because CVEs suffer from inherent network delays and often have cumbersome user interfaces. Little is known about the ef-fectiveness of collaboration in tasks requiring various forms of object sharing and, in particular, the concurrent manipu-lation of objects. This paper investigates the effectiveness of supporting teamwork among a geographically distributed group in a task that requires the shared manipulation of objects. To complete the task, users must share objects through con-current manipulation of both the same and distinct at-tributes. The effectiveness of teamwork is measured in terms of time taken to achieve each step, as well as the impression of users. The effect of interface is examined by comparing various combinations of walk-in cubic immersive projection technology (IPT) displays and desktop devices.},

When we attempt to support tele-presence between people, there are two main technologies that can be used today: video-conferencing (VC) and collaborative virtual environments (CVEs). In VC, one can observe eye-gaze behaviour but practically the targets of eye-gaze are only correct if the participants remain relatively still. We attempt to support eye-gaze behaviour in an unconstrained manner by integrating eye-trackers into an Immersive CVE (ICVE) system. This paper aims to show that while both ICVE and VC allow people to discern being looked at and what else is looked at, when someone gazes into their space from another location, ICVE alone can continue to do this as people move. The conditions of aligned VC, ICVE, eye-gaze enabled ICVE and co-location are compared. The impact of factors of alignment, lighting, resolution, and perspective distortion are minimised through a set of pilot experiments, before a formal experiment records results for optimal settings. Results show that both VC and ICVE support eye-gaze in constrained situations, but only ICVE supports movement of the observer. We quantify the mis-judgements that are made and discuss how our findings might inform research into supporting eye-gaze through interpolated free viewpoint video based methods.},

Interpersonal distance, gaze, posture and facial expression, are interpreted together to manage and add meaning to most conversations. Yet today's technologies favor some above others. This induces confusion in conversations, and is believed to limit both feelings of togetherness and trust, and growth of empathy and rapport. Solving this problem will allow technologies to support most rather than a few interactional scenarios. It is likely to benefit teamwork and team cohesion, distributed decision-making and health and wellbeing applications such as tele-therapy, tele-consultation, and isolation. We introduce withyou, our telepresence research platform. This paper describes the end-to-end system including the psychology of human interaction and how this drives requirements throughout the design and implementation. Our technology approach is to combine the winning characteristics of video conferencing and immersive collaborative virtual environments. This is to allow, for example, people walking past each other to exchange a glance and smile. A systematic explanation of the theory brings together the linked nature of non-verbal communication and how it is influenced by technology. This leads to functional requirements for telepresence, in terms of the balance of visual, spatial and temporal qualities. The first end-to-end description of withyou describes all major processes and the display and capture environment. An unprecedented characterization of our approach is given in terms of the above qualities and what influences them. This leads to non-functional requirements in terms of number and place of cameras and the avoidance of resultant bottlenecks. Proposals are given for improved distribution of processes across networks, computers, and multi-core CPU and GPU. Simple conservative estimation shows that both approaches should meet our requirements. One is implemented and shown to meet minimum and come close to desirable requirements.},

The scene is set by explaining why Immersive Virtuality Telepresence has the potential to meet the grand challenge of faithfully communicating both the appearance and the focus of attention of a remote human participant within a shared 3D computer-supported context. Within the experiment n=22 participants rotated static 3D virtuality humans, reconstructed from surround images, until they felt most looked at. The dependent variable was absolute angular error, which was compared to that underpinning social gaze behaviour in the natural world. Independent variables were 1) relative orientations of eye, head and body of captured subject; and 2) subset of cameras used to texture the form. Analysis looked for statistical and practical significance and qualitative corroborating evidence. The analysed results tell us much about the importance and detail of the relationship between gaze pose, method of video based reconstruction, and camera arrangement. They tell us that virtuality can reproduce gaze to an accuracy useful in social interaction, but with the adopted method of Video Based Reconstruction, this is highly dependent on combination of gaze pose and camera arrangement. This suggests changes in the VBR approach in order to allow more flexible camera arrangements. The work is of interest to those wanting to support expressive meetings that are both socially and spatially situated, and particular those using or building Immersive Virtuality Telepresence to accomplish this. It is also of relevance to the use of virtuality humans in applications ranging from the study of human interactions to gaming and the crossing of the stage line in films and TV.},

The sharing of information and artefacts is a central part of collaboration. This often involves the manipulation of shared objects, both sequentially as well as concurrently. For coordinating an efficient collaboration, communication between the team members is necessary. This can happen verbally in form of speech or text and non-verbally through gesturing, pointing, gaze or facial expressions and the referencing and manipulation of shared objects. Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVE) allow remote users to come together and interact with each other and virtual objects within a computer simulated environment. Immersive display interfaces, such as a walk-in display (e.g. CAVE), that place a human physically into the synthetic environment, lend themselves well to support a natural manipulation of objects as well a set of natural non-verbal human communication, as they can both capture and display human movement. Communication of tracking data, however, can saturate the network and result in delay or loss of messages vital to the manipulation of shared objects. This paper investigates the reality of shared object manipulation between remote users collaborating through linked walk-in displays and extends our research in [27]. Various forms of shared interaction are examined through a set of structured sub tasks within a representative construction task. We report on extensive user-trials between three walk-in displays in the UK and Austria linked over the Internet using a CVE, and demonstrate such effects on a naive implementation of a benchmark application, the Gazebo building task. We then present and evaluate application-level workarounds and conclude by suggesting solutions that may be implemented within next-generation CVE infrastructures.},

Experimental methods typically involve a significant level of abstraction from reality, with participants required to carry out tasks that are far removed from violence in real life, and hence their ecological validity is questionable. On the other hand studies based on field data, while having ecological validity, cannot control multiple confounding variables that may have an impact on observed results, so that their internal validity is questionable. It is argued that immersive virtual reality may provide a unification of these two approaches. Since people tend to respond realistically to situations and events that occur in virtual reality, and since virtual reality simulations can be completely controlled for experimental purposes, studies of responses to violence within virtual reality are likely to have both ecological and internal validity. This depends on a property that we call 'plausibility' - including the fidelity of the depicted situation with prior knowledge and expectations. We illustrate this with data from a previously published experiment, a virtual reprise of Stanley Milgram's 1960s obedience experiment, and also with pilot data from a new study being developed that looks at bystander responses to violent incidents.},

Interaction is a relational, interdependent process that constitutes social structure. Applying a network perspective to meeting interactions allows us to take account of the social structure. The aim of this study was to use social network analysis to distinguish functional and dysfunctional interaction structures and gain insight into the facilitation of meetings by analyzing antecedents and consequences of functional interaction structures. Data were based on a field study in which 51 regular meetings were videotaped and coded with act4teams. Analyses revealed that compared with dysfunctional networks, functional interaction is less centralized and has a positive effect on team performance. Social similarity has a crucial effect on functional interaction because participants significantly interact with others who are similar in personal initiative and self-efficacy. Our results provide important information about how to assist the interaction process and promote team success.},

We compare collaboration in networked immersive projection technology (IPT's) systems with previous results concerning collaboration in an IPT system linked with a desktop computer, and also with collaboration on the same task in the real world. Our findings show that the task performance in networked IPT's and in the real scenario are very similar to each other---whereas IPT-to-desktop performance is much poorer. Results about participants' experience of `presence', `co-presence' and collaboration shed further light on these findings.},

This paper gives an up-to-date overview of research in this diverse field. It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space. A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli. An investigation shows there has been substantial research for developing methods for measuring presence and research regarding factors that contribute to presence. Knowledge of these contributing factors can play a vital role in development of new VR applications, but key knowledge elements in this area are still missing.},

The three systems differed by how many participants were visible at once, their spatial arrangement, and control over who was seen. Conversations using these systems were compared to same-room (Experiment 1) and audio-only (Experiment 2) conversations. Specialized speech-tracking equipment recorded the on-off patterns of speech that allowed objective measurement of structural aspects of the conversations, such as turn length, pauses, and interruptions. Questionnaires and interviews also documented participants' opinions and perceptions in the various settings. Contrary to expectation, systems in which visual cues such as selective gaze were absent produced no differences in turn-taking or in any other aspect of the structure of conversation. In fact, turn-taking was unaffected even when visual information was completely absent. Overall, only the same-room condition showed any significant differences from any other condition; people in the same room produced more interruptions and fewer formal handovers of the floor than in any of the technology-mediated conditions. In this respect, the audio-only and video systems examined in these studies were equivalent. However, analyses of participants' perceptions showed that participants felt that visual access in mediated conversations was both important and beneficial in conversation. Further, there were indications that the particular design of the different video systems did affect some aspects of conversational behavior, such as the ability to hold side and parallel conversations.},

This is used to compute the fundamental matrices and the temporal offsets between many view-pairs in the network. Knowing the time-shifts between enough view-pairs allows us to robustly synchronize the whole network. The calibration of all the cameras is recovered from these fundamental matrices. The dynamic shape of the object can then be recovered using a visual-hull algorithm. Our method is especially useful for multi-camera shape-from-silhouette systems, as visual hulls can now be reconstructed without the need for a specific calibration session.},

To illustrate the point, an arbitrary mental attribute called ?colorfulness of the experience? is conjured up, and a set of questions administered to 74 respondents with an online questionnaire. The results suggested that colorfulness of yesterday's experiences was associated with the extent to which a person accomplished their tasks, and also associated with yesterday being a ?good?, ?pleasant?, but not frustrating day. The meaning lessness of this analysis illustrates that the equivalent methodology used by presence researchers, may, similarly, bring into being the idea of presence in the minds of VE participants. However, it is argued that there can be no evidence on this methodological basis that presence played any role in their actual mental activity or behavior at the time of the experience. It is concluded that presence researchers must move away from heavy reliance on questionnaires in order to make any progress in this area.},

The purpose of the experiment was not to examine task performance, but to compare various aspects of the social relations among the group members in the two environments. Ten groups of three people each, who had never met before, met first in a shared VE and carried out a task that required the identification and solution of puzzles that were presented on pieces of paper displayed around the walls of a room. The puzzle involved identifying that the same-numbered words across all the pieces of paper formed a riddle or saying. The group continued this task for fifteen minutes, and then stopped to answer a questionnaire. The group then reconvened in the real world and continued the same task. The experiment also required one of the group members to continually monitor a particular one of the others in order to examine whether social discomfort could be generated within a VE. In each group, there was one immersed person with a head-mounted display and head-tracking and two non-immersed people who experienced the environment on a workstation display. The results suggest that the immersed person tended to emerge as the leader in the virtual group, but not in the real meeting. Group accord tended to be higher in the real meeting than in the virtual meeting. Socially conditioned responses such as embarrassment could be generated in the virtual meeting, even though the individuals were presented to one another by very simple avatars. The study also found a positive relationship between presence of being in a place and copresence - the sense of being with the other people. Accord in the group increased with presence, the performance of the group, and the presence of women in the group.

Individuals' ability both to detect subtle differences in eye-gaze direction (e.g., where someone is looking in the environment) and to subsequently use these gaze cues to engage in joint attention with others was assessed. Age-related declines were found in the detection of the most subtle differences in gaze aversion. The ability to engage in joint attention by following gaze cues also declined with age. These age differences were not solely attributable to age impairments in visual perception and visual attention. The potential role of age-related neural declines in social perception problems was considered, along with the implications that age deficits in these basic social skills may have for older adults' social perception.},

When projected by a modified DLP projector (color filters removed), this color pattern results in three grayscale patterns projected sequentially at a frequency of 240 Hz. A high-speed B/W CCD camera synchronized with the projector captures the three images, from which the 3D shape of the object is reconstructed. A color CCD camera is also used to capture images for texture mapping. The maximum 3D shape acquisition speed is 120 Hz (532 $\times$ 500 pixels), which is high enough for capturing the 3D shapes of moving objects. Two coding methods, sinusoidal phase-shifting method and trapezoidal phase-shifting method, were tested and results with good accuracy were obtained. The trapezoidal phase-shifting algorithm also makes real-time 3D reconstruction possible.},

In these situations, design is fundamentally an interactive process that requires communication among users, designers, and developers. However, communication among these groups is often difficult although of paramount importance to design outcomes. Through a qualitative analysis of a house, expert system, and telecommunications network architecture and management system design situations, a descriptive model of design that characterizes communication among users, designers, and developers as they create an artifact was developed. The model describes design phases, roles, themes, and intergroup communication networks as they evolve throughout the design process and characterizes design as a process of ``contested collaboration''. It is a first step towards a predictive design model that suggests strategies which may help participants interact more effectively and ultimately improve the quality of design outcomes and the design process.},

The distortions inherent in 3D displays hamper judging relative positions, whereas the integration of dimensions in 3D displays facilitates shape understanding. We confirmed these hypotheses with two initial experiments involving simple block shapes. The shape-understanding tasks were identification or mental rotation. The relative-position tasks were locating shadows and determining directions and distances between objects. We then extended the results to four experiments involving complex natural terrain. We compare our distinction with the integral/separable task distinction of Haskel and Wickens (1993). Applications for this research include displays for air traffic control, geoplots for military command and control, and potentially, any display of 3D information.},

In this study, drawing upon the literature on social presence, media richness, and media appropriateness that relate media choice to task characteristics and objectives, we identify 19 objectives for business meetings. We then present hypotheses on the effectiveness of various meeting modes for achieving these objectives, focusing on the social presence dimension of four meeting modes (audio-conferencing, video-conferencing, telepresence, and face-to-face). We test these hypotheses using survey data from a large company in which all the technologies are available on a relatively broad basis.},

This paper presents a model-based approach to recover animated models of people from multiple view video images. Two contributions are made, a multiple resolution model-based framework is introduced that combines multiple visual cues in reconstruction. Second, a novel mesh parameterisation is presented to preserve the vertex parameterisation in the model for animation. A prior humanoid surface model is first decomposed into multiple levels of detail and represented as a hierarchical deformable model for image fitting. A novel mesh parameterisation is presented that allows propagation of deformation in the model hierarchy and regularisation of surface deformation to preserve vertex parameterisation and animation structure. The hierarchical model is then used to fuse multiple shape cues from silhouette, stereo and sparse feature data in a coarse-to-fine strategy to recover a model that reproduces the appearance in the images. The framework is compared to physics-based deformable surface fitting at a single resolution, demonstrating an improved reconstruction accuracy against ground-truth data with a reduced model distortion. Results demonstrate realistic modelling of real people with accurate shape and appearance while preserving model structure for use in animation.},

We report on a study designed to evaluate methods of avatar eye gaze control during an object-focused puzzle scenario performed between three networked CAVEtrade-like systems. We compare tracked gaze, in which avatars' eyes are controlled by head-mounted mobile eye trackers worn by participants, to a gaze model informed by head orientation for saccade generation, and static gaze featuring non-moving eyes. We analyse task performance, subjective user experience, and interactional behaviour. While not providing statistically significant benefit over static gaze, tracked gaze is observed as the highest performing condition. However, the gaze model resulted in significantly lower task performance and increased error rate.},

While video-mediated communication (VMC) is the most widely used form of interpersonal remote interaction, avatar-mediated communication (AMC) in shared virtual environments is increasingly common. This paper presents two experiments investigating eye tracking in AMC. The first experiment compares the degree of social presence experienced in AMC and VMC during truthful and deceptive discourse. Eye tracking data (gaze, blinking, and pupil size) demonstrates that oculesic behavior is similar in both mediation types, and uncovers systematic differences between truth telling and lying. Subjective measures show users' psychological arousal to be greater in VMC than AMC. The second experiment demonstrates that observers of AMC can more accurately detect truth and deception when viewing avatars with added oculesic behavior driven by eye tracking. We discuss implications for the design of future visual telecommunication media interfaces.},

He has developed a system capable of estimating participants' focus of attention from multiple cues. In the system he employs an omni-directional camera to simultaneously track the faces of participants sitting around a meeting table and uses neural networks to estimate their head poses. In addition, he uses microphones to detect who is speaking. The system predicts participants' focus of attention from acoustic and visual information separately, and then combines the output of the audio- and video-based focus of attention predictors. In addition he reports recent experimental results: In order to determine how well we can predict a subject's focus of attention solely on the basis of his or her head orientation, he has conducted an experiment in which he recorded head and eye orientations of participants in a meeting using special tracking equipment. The results demonstrate that head orientation was a sufficient indicator of the subjects' focus target in 89\% of the time. Furthermore he discusses how the neural networks used to estimate head orientation can be adapted to work in new locations and under new illumination conditions.},

Any such system must have components for sensing, feature extraction, modeling, and matching. A structured light system which attempts to deliver a rich 2/sup 1///sub 2/D representation of the scene is described. Surface patches are evident as connected sets of stripes whose 3D coordinates are computed by means of triangulation and constraint propagation. Object edges are detected by the intersection of surface patches or by backprojecting image edges to intersect with the patches. Two matching paradigms are given for drawing correspondence between structures in the scene representation and structures in models. Three major contributions are reported: a method for sensing object surface patches without having to solve uniquely for stripe labels; the use of both an intensity image and a striped image, allowing scenes to be represented by detected edges along with 3D surface patches; and a pose-clustering algorithm, a uniform technique to accumulate matching evidence for recognition while averaging out substantial errors of pose.},

The portion of the human-likeness spectrum in which such aversion is posited to occur is referred to as the ``uncanny valley''. However, evidence in support of the UVH is primarily based on subjectively assessed evaluations. Thus it remains an open question as to whether there are behavioral or neurophysiological manifestations of uncanny valley effects. To address this gap in literature, we investigated the activation of the anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC) - a region of the brain associated with emotion regulation - in response to a series of robots with varying human-likeness. We hypothesized that highly human-like robots - which have been found to receive negative subjective attributions - will also elicit increased activity in the PFC versus humans or robots with lesser degrees of human-likeness in accordance with the UVH. Our results show a ``valley'' in brain activity in the PFC corresponding to the valley observed via subjective measures alone, thus suggesting one neural manifestation (the PFC) of uncanny valley effects and further supporting the affective response (aversion) posited to occur by the UVH. However, the results also reveal a second ``uncanny valley'' in prefrontal hemodynamics, which suggests that the effects (and the contributing factors) are more complex than previously understood.},

This provides the viewer with a comfortable degree of head movement. The retroreflecting screen, display hardware, infrared head tracker, and means of stabilizing the image position on the screen are explained. The performance of the display in terms of crosstalk, resolution, image distortion, and other parameters is described. Finally, applications of this display type are suggested.},

All of the na{\"\i}ve participants (n = 21) successfully believed that they had experienced live scenes when recorded scenes had been presented. Additional psychophysical experiments suggest the depth of visual objects does not affect the perceptual discriminability between scenes, and the scene switch during head movement enhance substitutional performance.

Acuity for eye direction was quite high (approximately 30 s arc). Viewing the movement of the looker's eyes did not improve acuity. When one of the looker's eyes was occluded, the observers' acuity was disrupted and their point of subjective equality was shifted away from the exposed eye. Experiment 2 was a replication of Experiment 1, but digitized gaze displays were used. The results of Experiment 3 showed that the acuity for direction of gaze depended on the position of the looker's target. Overall, the results indicated that humans are highly sensitive to gaze direction and that information from both eyes is used to determine direction of regard.},

It also refers to an advanced type of teleoperation system that enables an operator at the controls to perform remote tasks dexterously with the feeling of existing in a surrogate robot. Although conventional telexistence systems provide an operator the real-time sensation of being in a remote environment, persons in the remote environment have only the sensation that a surrogate robot is present, not the operator. Mutual telexistence aims to solve this problem so that the existence of the operator is apparent to persons in the remote environment by providing mutual sensations of presence. This paper proposes a method of mutual telexistence using projection technology with retro-reflective objects, and describes experimental hardware constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.},

Photorefractive polymers are dynamic holographic recording materials that allow updating of images and have a wide range of applications, including optical correlation, imaging through scattering media and optical communication. To be suitable for 3D displays, photorefractive polymers need to have nearly 100\% diffraction efficiency, fast writing time, hours of image persistence, rapid erasure, and large area-a combination of properties that has not been shown before. Here, we report an updatable holographic 3D display based on photorefractive polymers with such properties, capable of recording and displaying new images every few minutes. This is the largest photorefractive 3D display to date (4 x 4 inches in size); it can be recorded within a few minutes, viewed for several hours without the need for refreshing, and can be completely erased and updated with new images when desired.},

The direction of this apparent shift is opposite to the shift of the light source. We demonstrated the illumination-induced apparent orientation shift (IAOS), quantified it in terms of the physical orientation shift needed to compensate for it, and evaluated the results in the context of possible mechanisms underlying orientation judgment. Results indicate that IAOS depends not only on the angle between the two light source positions, but also on the mean orientation of the face. Availability of cues coded in the visual texture of the face did not affect IAOS. The most effective cue was the location of the visible outline of the face. IAOS seems to be due to a shift of this outline when shadowed areas on the face merge with the black background. We conclude that an important mechanism for orientation judgment is based on a comparison of visible parts left and right of the profile line.},

This paper mainly focuses on the acceleration of back-projection from silhouette images to 3D space without using any sophisticated software technique, such as octree volume representation, or look-up table based projection acceleration. Also this paper presents a parallel intersection method of projected silhouette images. From the preliminary experimental results we estimate near frame-rate volume reconstruction for a life-sized mannequin can be achieved at 3 cm spatial resolution on our PC cluster system.},

It over- comes limitations of the existing Patch-Sweep approach, such as limited search range. Further, it implicitly benefits from the high robustness as well as time consistency of the disparity estimator. The presented overall algorithmic system concept introduces a powerful alternative to traditional real-time depth estimation approaches. Additionally, the proposed algorithmic structures allow a high degree of parallelization. Based on this, the computational effort could be efficiently balanced between GPU and CPU processing. The target platform of the proposed algorithmic chain is a real-time immersive 3D video communication system which requires highly accurate 3D estimation results for a high quality virtual eye contact generation.},

Unlike the other cues, selective gaze depends critically on the configuration of cameras and monitors. Under isotropic videoconferencing conditions people see each other in spatially consistent directions (shared video space). Isotropy is hypothesized to regulate the interactional process of conversation. Further, it is hypothesized that isotropy increases social nearness which increases persuasive force but decreases the exchange of information in group discussion tasks. We have studied the interactional process and task outcome of two discussion tasks under isotropic and (standard) non-isotropic videoconferencing conditions relative to face-to-face conditions. The communication of unshared information was tested in a `hidden profile' task by Stasser et al.[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 31 (1995) 244]. Dominance and persuasive force were revealed using a prioritization game of survival items called `Lost at the moon', featuring a dominant confederate. The results support our hypotheses and have revealed that persuasive force (the ability to change another person's opinion) is significantly stronger under isotropic conditions (including face-to-face) than under non-isotropic conditions. In contrast, dominance (the ability to influence group solutions by dominant behavior) is similar for all conditions. Further, participants communicate almost twice as much unshared information under mediated conditions than under the face-to-face condition.},

The planning, training and analysis of on-orbit servicing (OOS) missions performed by astronauts or through remote operation using a robot is often time consuming and costly. Virtual Reality (VR) enables simulation and training in a flexible and safe environment. This paper describes an interactive real-time environment that supports a number of OOS tasks within an immersive VR environment. The system simulates the dynamic and kinematic behaviour of satellite components and provides photo-realistic visualization of satellite parts and the space environment. It integrates user interaction with haptic force feedback through a bi-manual haptic human machine interface, as well as simulates and interfaces to a humanoid robot for tele-operation.In order to provide a realistic experience at interactive frame rates, we propose a distributed system architecture, where the load of computing the physics simulation, haptic feedback and visualization of the complex scene is transferred to dedicated machines. The modular architecture is designed to allow the inclusion of further simulation processes. Several mechanisms for reducing the communication traffic have been implemented. This paper gives an overview of the system architecture, outlines the software implementation and documents an evaluation of the real-time performance of our system in detail. We describe how system performance was measured in terms of simulation timings and distribution load, as well as report on latencies at several stages. Results show that our distributed system is capable of providing visual and haptic feedback at high frame rates required for user interaction with end-to-end latencies of less than 8?ms and 3?ms, respectively.},

Projected into each space are avatar representations of remote participants, that reproduce not only body, head and hand movements, but also those of the eyes. Spatial and temporal alignment of remote spaces allows the focus of gaze as well as activity and gesture to be used as a resource for non-verbal communication. The temporal challenge met was to reproduce eye movements quick enough and often enough to interpret their focus during a multi-way interaction, along with communicating other verbal and non-verbal language. The spatial challenge met was to maintain communicational eye gaze while allowing free movement of participants within a virtually shared common frame of reference. This paper reports on the technical and especially temporal characteristics of the system.},

Recently, not only the 2D images but also 3D shapes of a moving person are desired in kinds of cases, such as motion analysis, security monitoring, 3D video creation and so on. In this paper, we propose a parallel pipeline system on a PC cluster for reconstructing the 3D shape of a moving person in real-time. For the 3D shape reconstruction, we have extended the volume intersection method to the 3-base-plane volume intersection. By thus extension, the computation is accelerated greatly for arbitrary camera layouts. We also parallelized the 3-base-plane method and implemented it on a PC cluster. On each node, the pipeline processing is adopted to improve the throughput. To decrease the CPU idle time caused by I/O processing, image capturing, communications over nodes and so on, we implement the pipeline using multiple threads. So that, all stages can be executed concurrently. However, there exists resource conflicts between stages in a real system. To avoid the conflicts while keeping high percentage of CPU running time, we propose a tree structured thread control model. As a result, We achieve the performance as obtaining the full 3D volumes of a moving person at about 12 frames per second, where the voxel size is 5$\times$5$\times$5 [mm^3]. The effectiveness of the thread tree model in such real-time computation is also proved by the experimental results.},

In an observational study of Second Life, a virtual community, we collected data from avatars in order to explore whether social norms of gender, interpersonal distance (IPD), and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments even though the modality of movement is entirely different (i.e., via keyboard and mouse as opposed to eyes and legs). Our results showed that established findings of IPD and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments: (1) male-male dyads have larger IPDs than female-female dyads, (2) male-male dyads maintain less eye contact than female-female dyads, and (3) decreases in IPD are compensated with gaze avoidance as predicted by the Equilibrium Theory. We discuss implications for users of online games as well as for social scientists who seek to conduct research in virtual environments.},

Since this technique is based on the parallax panoramagram, the parallax number and resolution are limited by the diffraction at the parallax barrier. In order to solve this problem, we improved the technique by revolving the parallax barrier. The improved technique was incorporated into two experimental display systems. The newer one is capable of displaying 3D color video images within a 200-mm diameter and a 256-mm height. Images have a resolution of 1254 circumferential pixels and 256 vertical pixels, and are refreshed at 30Hz. Each pixel has a viewing angle of 60 degrees that is divided into over 70 views so that the angular parallax interval of each pixel is less than 1 degree. These pixels are arranged on a cylindrical surface to allow for the produced 3D images to be observed from all directions. In this case, observers may barely perceive the discrete parallax.},

In common with many writers then and now, he believed that the evolutionary past is conserved in the mind and the brain. Today the ``evolutionary Freud'' is nearly forgotten. Even among Freudians, he is regarded to be a red herring, relevant only to the extent that he diverts attention from the enduring achievements of the authentic Freud. There are three ways to explain these attitudes. First, the evolutionary Freud's key work is the ``Overview of the Transference Neurosis'' (1915). But it was published at an inopportune moment, forty years after the author's death, during the so-called ``Freud wars.'' Second, Freud eventually lost interest in the ``Overview'' and the prospect of a comprehensive evolutionary theory of psychopathology. The publication of The Ego and the Id (1923), introducing Freud's structural theory of the psyche, marked the point of no return. Finally, Freud's evolutionary theory is simply not credible. It is based on just-so stories and a thoroughly discredited evolutionary mechanism, Lamarckian use-inheritance. Explanations one and two are probably correct but also uninteresting. Explanation number three assumes that there is a fundamental difference between Freud's evolutionary narratives (not credible) and the evolutionary accounts of psychopathology that currently circulate in psychiatry and mainstream journals (credible). The assumption is mistaken but worth investigating.},

A CUDA-accelerated real-time 3D modeling system is presented in this paper. It captures multi-view images of objects and achieves real-time accurate visual hull reconstruction with texture mapping. The system includes off-line camera calibration and on-line visual hull modeling based on our DreamWorld hardware. The multi-camera based modeling process is composed of distributed image acquisition, silhouette extraction, data transmission, visual hull computation and rendering. Initially, the volumetric visual hull is computed through intersection test of voxels with each silhouette and then, a CUDA-based simplified exact marching cubes algorithm is put forward to get a polyhedral mesh model for texture mapping and rendering. Preliminary experimental results from both synthetic and real data show its accuracy, stability and real-time performance.},

By exploiting the relationship between the dual images of spheres and the dual image of the absolute conic (IAC), it is shown that the common pole and polar with regard to the conic images of two spheres are also the pole and polar with regard to the IAC. This provides two constraints for estimating the IAC and, hence, allows a camera to be calibrated from an image of at least three spheres.

Yet, this paper proposes a new calibration technique using 1D objects (points aligned on a line), thus filling the missing dimension in calibration. In particular, we show that camera calibration is not possible with free-moving 1D objects, but can be solved if one point is fixed. A closed-form solution is developed if six or more observations of such a 1D object are made. For higher accuracy, a nonlinear technique based on the maximum likelihood criterion is then used to refine the estimate. Singularities have also been studied. Besides the theoretical aspect, the proposed technique is also important in practice especially when calibrating multiple cameras mounted apart from each other, where the calibration objects are required to be visible simultaneously.},

The algorithm is based on a progressive multiresolution pipeline that includes background modeling and dense matching with adaptive windows. For applications in which only moving objects are of interest, this approach effectively reduces the overall computation cost quite significantly and preserves the high definition details. Estimating depth from stereo is a classic computer vision problem, which has received tremendous attention since the early days. Recovering 3D information from a pair of stereo cameras has been a popular topic because the additional 3D information provided by this technology contains significantly more information than 2D information produced by traditional cameras. Some believe that this technology will fundamentally revolutionize the computer vision signal-processing pipeline, as well as how future cameras will be built. The current implementation achieves 36 Hz stereo matching on 1024 $\times$ 768 stereo video with a fine 256-pixel disparity range. The focus of this work is to provide efficient high-resolution stereo algorithms for real-time applications in which only foreground moving objects are of interest, such as motion capture, object tracking, and recognition and identification in a surveillance scenario.},
