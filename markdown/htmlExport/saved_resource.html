<h4>
<span>1.1 </span>Overview</h4>
<div id="Ch1.S1.p1">
<p id="Ch1.S1.p1.1">As human beings, we have always relied on certain social constructs to guide our interactions and transactions with one another. Money and trust are two such constructs that have played a vital role in shaping our societies, and the way we live our lives. However, the digital age has brought with it new challenges that are testing the foundations of these social norms.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S1.p2">
<p id="Ch1.S1.p2.1">In a world where we are increasingly connected through the internet and able to communicate with people from all corners of the globe, the concept of money and trust is changing. Gone are the days of the village structure in which we evolved, where personal relationships and face-to-face interactions were ubiquitous. Now, we are faced with the prospect of working and interacting one another, and also with artificial intelligence actors that seem subjectively real, all while navigating the complexities of a global mixed reality.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S1.p3">
<p id="Ch1.S1.p3.1">This transition to a more efficient and interconnected world has the potential to bring about great benefits, but it also presents us with an enormous challenge. The chaotic and intangible mix of value, trust, socialisation, generative art, and AI chat actors, is not yet well understood, and it will take time for us to adapt to this new way of living and interacting with one another.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S1.p4">
<p id="Ch1.S1.p4.1">We initially wanted to explore exciting new developments in the transmission of value, and trust, in ‘digital society’. The problem is that each of these topics alone are enormously complex, and the intersections seem to be more so. We have been researching the current state-of-the-art, and the emerging consensus narrative, to try to figure out how the collision of these technologies might serve our virtual production workflows (Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch7.F9" title="Figure 7.9 ‣ 7.14.1 Virtual Production ‣ 7.14 Unreal &amp; Virtual Production ‣ Chapter 7 Collaborative mixed reality ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>7.9</span></a>). As we worked on this research the Cambrian explosion of generative AI added an incredibly important new strand to our investigation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S1.p5">
<p id="Ch1.S1.p5.1">Over the course of a couple of years the focus of the work has developed, and refined. Our tool-kit, as it stands, supports inclusive human creativity and economic exchange, especially for emerging markets and especially perhaps <a href="https://www.afrobitcoin.org/" title="">Africa</a>. There is a huge proportion of human creativity currently excluded from media production pipelines due to gatekeepers of knowledge, access to identity proofs, and financial infrastructure that is taken for granted in the richer nations. This inclusion will be accomplished for the most part through integration of open source machine learning and AI tools, but this field quite new, and that part of the work is under developed.</p></div>

<div id="Ch1.S1.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch1.S1.SS1.p1.1">Trust and safety (T&amp;S) is crucially important for building ethical and inclusive online communities, the landscape is fraught with complex tradeoffs and challenges that make direct involvement difficult for independent researchers and developers like us. As summarized in a recent <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/scaling-trust/" title="">Atlantic Council report</a>, T&amp;S operates in a high-stakes environment driven by commercial incentives that often conflict with safety objectives. Practitioners face threats of trauma, burnout, and retaliation when enforcing policies. The field itself lacks established standards, struggles to quantify impact, and relies heavily on the judgement of private companies.</p><ul id="Ch1.S1.I1">

<p id="Ch1.S1.SS1.p1.2">As independent researchers focused on decentralized and generative technologies, we believe the greatest value we can provide is advancing capabilities that empower users and diversify governance models. Directly mediating harms involves subjective tradeoffs we are not comfortable imposing on others. Our goal is to expand possibilities for human flourishing, while avoiding direct content moderation that restricts expression based on our own limited perspectives. We aim to enable solutions, not dictate them. As the report advocates, addressing T&amp;S issues requires a broad coalition encompassing civil society, government, academia, and industry. We can make a positive contribution through technology R&amp;D, while leaving nuanced governance decisions to more representative institutions. There are many valid ways to build a more trustworthy web; given our background and values, we have chosen to focus on expanding generativity rather than regulating spaces.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>1.2 </span>Introduction</h4>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p1">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p1.1">This book is a high level view of technologies and their potential within the developing digital society narrative, focusing around the transmission of value within and across immersive global networks, with a further focus on the Bitcoin monetary network.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p2">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p2.1">Cybersecurity is top of the list of concerns in the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies" title="">EU digital society strategy</a>, just ahead of digital inclusion, so we started out with security best practices in mind, and we tried to end the investigation with inclusion. We aimed to support small and especially developing companies in our sector, giving them a foot in the door on a global stage, without their costs spiralling.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p3">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p3.1">Fortunately, we discovered a wealth of carefully crafted open source tools which can support this. <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" title="">Open source software</a> is software that is available with source code that can be modified and distributed by anyone. The model extended into other creative works through things like the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/" title="">Creative Commons</a> licenses, which is itself an <a href="https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/" title="">‘open standard’</a>. We will return to these themes throughout the book, and both this text and the supporting code are open source. This means that anyone can access, use, and modify the source code for their own purposes. Open source software is often developed and maintained by a community of volunteers. This approach to software development allows for more collaboration and innovation, as well as greater transparency and security. Many popular software programs, such as the Linux operating system and the Apache web server, are open source.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p4">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p4.1">We have tried to assemble the tools we found, cogently, to deliver an open source kit for experimentation, to curious technically individuals and groups, and we have applied our own security knowledge on top of an already first class set of tools. It’s certainly not production ready, but it’s good enough to commit small amounts of money into, and collaboration is welcomed.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p5">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p5.1">Whilst researching, it seemed that every door we opened was full of interesting and useful treats. What was supposed to be a short technical paper quickly became a 400-page book, and a deployable virtual machine stack, with a dozen different open source components in it.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p6">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p6.1">This book supports the software stack, which supports anyone who thinks this material might be useful. Below is a précis of the chapters of the book, which will hopefully give an insight into what “this stuff” is. The reader can decide to download the book and the system “How To” guide. All of it can be contributed to on GitHub, all of it will be developed forward, and none of it is really finished yet.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p7">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p7.1">Chapter 1 starts with an introduction to the book which is about value transmission, with distributed trust, in global digital society and mixed reality systems.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p8">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p8.1">Next is a summary of Web3, as it stands right now. Web3 is a complex term that is cropping up far more in the technical press, so we wanted explain what it might mean. It’s still pretty confusing. There are a bunch of legacy explanations which are Web3.0 (note the ‘0’ there), but these are withering on the vine. Then there’s the new VC funded, super hyped, and potentially useless Web3 incarnations, which again cover a slew of intersecting technologies. Note they dropped the zero to reboot the brand! This doesn’t mean there’s nothing to see here. The astonishing amount of <a href="https://mirror.xyz/tr3butor.eth/AlZPMq_syymAoi8M1VVb2xES9Twj1OeetJbEE7EWhiw" title="">money and developer talent</a>, and the clear market hunger for things like NFTs (non-fungible tokens) suggest that there’s a future for Web3, it’s just really unclear if this is inherently valuable or just hype.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p9">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p9.1">In the next chapter we took a look at blockchain, which is very intersectional with Web3. Even on its own this is a complex emergent set of disciplines. The blockchain chapter was especially interesting to research. It turns out there’s a <span id="Ch1.S2.p9.1.1">lot</span> of ways to get this technology wrong. Even very appealing options on paper, turn out to have very shaky foundations. There are valuable things here, but given the complexity and scope, we decided to focus on the most promising of the technology stacks; the Bitcoin network.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p10">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p10.1">Even Bitcoin isn’t just Bitcoin any more. It’s a swarm of open source tools which can (in theory) accomplish a great many things. These are illustrated well in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch1.F2" title="Figure 1.2 ‣ 1.2 Introduction ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>1.2</span></a>.</p></div>

</figure>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p11">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p11.1">These newer, ancillary elements to Bitcoin, are emergent right now. Some of them won’t be around until next year, and it’s questionable whether they will even work out. With that said we aren’t convinced by the value proposition of of Ethereum, and there’s enough Bitcoin tooling for us to cherry pick useful components. We map those forward into our metaverse product.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p12">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p12.1">The next chapter is about Money. In expanding our research on Bitcoin, we found that it’s impossible to think about the tech without opening up a whole line of questions about money itself. This is fine because we set out to look at global value transfer for business. It’s not a trivial subject though, and this section tries to overview why value and Bitcoin are so enmeshed, then what other options there might be in the end (because Bitcoin has kicked off a whole slew of global adoption outside of itself). Chapter five extends this look at global money systems and examines corruption, governance, and opportunities for digital society to affect change and equality.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p13">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p13.1">The distributed identity management, and trust chapter follows. Identity management is important for digital society and potentially crucial to metaverse applications which have a value transaction layer. It’s not an easy section to write about, because there’s a lot of research, it’s not our field, and finding the value and the right target audience has been very difficult. It’s by no means clear that blockchain is the right tool for this component, and newer cryptographic products are emerging. We select an exciting emergent protocol called Nostr which we believe can help us knit together many elements of digital society.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p14">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p14.1">In chapter 7 we take another look at NFTs. It’s impossible to ignore this stuff now. It’s fundamentally a bit broken, but there are probably use cases, and the money and development attention it’s getting are incredible. We try to navigate our hypothetical virtual production partners through this as best we can.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p15">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p15.1">We’re actually pretty excited about future versions of ‘digital assets’, based around Bitcoin, because that allows us to keep just one software stack, minimising the threat surface. We’ve mapped that forward into the open source tools that we recommend.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p16">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p16.1">Chapter 8 is a big one for us as it’s our research area prior to opening up the Bitcoin box(es). Metaverse, or at least one of the current definitions of metaverse, is just social interaction in mixed reality (VR/AR/XR). We’ve been studying that for decades, so this section is more academic and tries to boil down what we think is most important. The choices we made here guided us toward the selection of free and open source metaverse software.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p17">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p17.1">We also take a look at the other definitions of ‘metaverse’ which are doing the rounds on the web, try to unpick which is which, and what they are for, and attempt to weave back together the best of both. This ends up looking a bit like the Venn in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch10.F1" title="Figure 10.1 ‣ 10.1 Introduction and Problem Definition ‣ Chapter 10 Our proposition ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>10.1</span></a>, where we have transmission of provable identity, non-fungible tokens bearing value or data, distributed files, actual money (including micropayments) and a social layer based on our best knowledge about mixed reality. In the end we abandon the word metaverse and settle on ‘digital society’ as our preferred term.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.p18">
<p id="Ch1.S2.p18.1">Chapter 9 is a work in progress and looks at how the recent explosion in generative art, and machine learning language models might help drive equality and equity of access globally. Past this stage in the book we get into the murky and half developed tail end, where we’re interfacing with our design choices, and the stack which can be deployed into the cloud.</p></div>

<div id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p1.1">As adoption of these technologies increases it will be necessary for people, and AI actors, to pass economic value between themselves. These ‘goods and services’ interactions, within the digital and virtual social spaces should be underpinned by a trust system, which scales globally and presents low friction. Current secure international payment rails are poorly suited to such interactions; indeed it is likely with legacy systems, that parties would be forced to leave the metaverse application, and instead navigate their banking applications to exchange value with overseas entities in a secure fashion. This might conceivably take several days.</p></div>

A collection of emerging technologies supports such experiences through dynamic virtual representations, environments and ecosystems of customers and people, as well as new modes of user engagement. With these technologies, individuals can control their own identities and data and experience virtual ecosystems that can be integrated with digital currencies. These technologies help reach customers in new ways to strengthen or open new revenue streams.
The technologies to watch that deliver evolving and expanding immersive experiences are metaverse, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), super apps and Web3, decentralized identity, digital humans, digital twin of the customer and internal talent marketplaces.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p4">
<p id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p4.1">Of their recent investments KPMG global said: <span id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p4.1.1">“We’ve invested in a strong cryptoassets practice and we will continue to enhance and build on our capabilities across Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and the Metaverse, to name a few”</span>. This is not to say that all fund managers are so positive.

<p id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p5.1">It’s possible that for such huge organisations it makes better business sense to take a punt on hype bubbles like this, than to do a proper due diligence with a team of internal staff who understand their business. These endorsements should be taken with a large pinch of salt. As <a href="https://newsletter.fintechtakes.com/p/metaverse-branches?s=r" title="">Alex Johnson says</a>: <span id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p5.1.1">“At some point in the future, it’s possible that the digital worlds being built today will have aggregated sufficient user attention and engagement that financial services companies will need to invest in the metaverse as an acquisition and customer service channel. But we’re not there yet. Until the metaverse is a little less empty, resist the temptation to colonize it with branches and billboards.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p6">
<p id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p6.1">Meanwhile, Meta (ex Facebook) are launching their own <a href="https://archive.ph/coyp2" title="">META Web3 and metaverse</a> token after abandoning Libre, their global cryptocurrency. Libre became Diem, then was quietly acquired by Silvergate bank, who likely integrated it into their SEN settlement network. Following the collase of Silvergate the bank was sold on without the SEN network, marking an ignominious end to the technology which possibly started the the rush to central bank digital currencies. <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/announcing-coinbase-google-cloud" title="">Google have formed a strategic partnership</a> with Coinbase, and <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/innovations-for-2022-at-youtube/" title="">recently blogged</a>: <span id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p6.1.1">“Web3 also opens up new opportunities for creators. We believe new technologies like blockchain and NFTs can allow creators to build deeper relationships with their fans. Together, they’ll be able to collaborate on new projects and make money in ways not previously possible. For example, giving a verifiable way for fans to own unique videos, photos, art, and even experiences from their favourite creators could be a compelling prospect for creators and their audiences. There’s a lot to consider in making sure we approach these new technologies responsibly, but we think there’s incredible potential as well. Finally, we couldn’t have a piece about innovation without touching on the metaverse! We’re thinking big about how to make viewing more immersive. ”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p7">
<p id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p7.1">It’s already the case that the recent bubble of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/03/10/interest-in-nfts-and-the-metaverse-is-falling-fast/?" title="">hype is dwindling</a>, but the enormous investment into teams and startups will potentially bear fruit in the next couple of years, and this perhaps has implications for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p8">
<p id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p8.1">It’s fortunate timing for this book that the UK government has signalled enthusiasm for so called ‘stablecoins’ at the same time that the Bitcoin network is being upgraded to transmit these GBP equivalent tokens around. This gives us a very good idea what it is we can build into our application stack. In the UK the government has stated it’s ambition to be a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-plan-to-make-uk-a-global-cryptoasset-technology-hub" title="">global cryptoasset technology hub</a>, and announced, then scrapped plans for the Royal Mint to issue a (novelty) NFT. Fuller, Economic Secretary to the Treasury <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19ZYKLeT-ds3TueTpqSM22MUqB4gmN_Pl/view" title="">said in a speech</a>: <span id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p8.1.1">“We want to become the country of choice for those looking to create, innovate and build in the crypto space […] By making this country a hospitable place for crypto technologies, we can attract investment, generate new jobs, benefit from tax revenues, create a wave of ground breaking new products and services, and bridge the current position of UK financial services into a new era.”</span></p></div>

Like the assertion by major global businesses it is too early to tell how ‘sticky’ these claims are. Indeed the findings of a recent treasury committee looking at the sector suggest that there is much work to do, with <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/158/treasury-committee/news/175634/treasury-committee-85-of-crypto-firms-failed-to-meet-minimum-standards-according-to-fca/" title="">85% of companies</a> failing to comply with <span id="Ch1.S2.SS1.p9.1.1">existing</span> law.

<span>1.3 </span>Summary</h4>
<div id="Ch1.S3.p1">
<p id="Ch1.S3.p1.1">With all this attention it seems timely to explore the potential of recent technologies, which can address collaborative mixed reality interactions in <span id="Ch1.S3.p1.1.1">business to business</span> (B2B), <span id="Ch1.S3.p1.1.2">business to customer</span> (B2C), and the newer C2C (social commerce; <span id="Ch1.S3.p1.1.3">creator to consumer, customer to customer, consumer to consumer<cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx1" title="">1</a>]</cite>)</span>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S3.p2">
<p id="Ch1.S3.p2.1">This book seeks to overview and explain the available open source technologies. It supports an open source <a href="https://github.com/flossverse/product" title="">github repository</a> which enables SMEs to access these emergent platforms and ecosystems. It aims to build toward a minimum viable product for trust minimised transfer of value within a social immersive space, but also across all internet connected devices.</p></div>
<div id="Ch1.S3.p3">
<p id="Ch1.S3.p3.1">Referencing is in two styles; academic works and books are numeric, while opinion pieces, gray statistics, and pertinent news articles are hyperlinked from the text. This hybrid style yields about twice the citation density of a normal PhD thesis, which is a lot. For this reason the normal blue hyperlink colour was eschewed in favour of a more aesthetic “gray”.</p></div>

<h3>
<span>Chapter 2 </span>Decentralisation &amp; The Web</h3>
<section id="Ch2.S1">
<h4>
<span>2.1 </span>Semantic web</h4>
<div id="Ch2.S1.p1">
<p id="Ch2.S1.p1.1">The “semantic web” definition of Web3.0 has been somewhat overhauled by other innovations in decentralised internet technologies, now evolving toward the slightly different Web3 moniker. Tim Berners Lee (of WWW fame) first mentioned the semantic web in 1999 <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx2" title="">2</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S1.p2">
<p id="Ch2.S1.p2.1">“I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A "Semantic Web", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The "intelligent agents" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.”</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S1.p3">
<p id="Ch2.S1.p3.1">Attention developed around three core themes, ubiquitous availability and searchability of data, intelligent search assistants, and highly available end points such as phones, and ‘internet of things’ devices. This is certainly manifesting in home devices, but few people think of this as a Web3 revolution.
Since ratification of the standards by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/" title="">World Wide Web (W3C) consortium</a> it seems that their imperative toward decentralisation has become lost. Instead, it can be seen that Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple have a harmful oligopoly on users data <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx3" title="">3</a>]</cite>. This is at odds with Berners-Lee’s vision, and he has recently <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lee-screw-web3-my-decentralized-internet-doesnt-need-blockchain/" title="">spoken out about this discrepancy</a>, and attempted to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/04/web-inventor-tim-berners-lee-wants-us-to-ignore-web3.html" title="">refocus the media</a> onto Web3.0.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S1.p4">
<p id="Ch2.S1.p4.1">It is worth taking a look at his software implementation called <a href="https://solidproject.org/" title="">Solid</a>, which is far more mindful of the sovereignty of user data.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S1.p5">
<p id="Ch2.S1.p5.1">“Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy. Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.”</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S1.p6">
<p id="Ch2.S1.p6.1">Excitement around this kind of differentiated trust model, hinted at in ubiquitous availability of data (and implemented explicitly in Solid), has led to exploration of different paths by cryptographers, and this will be described later. For instance, one of the main developers of Solid, <a href="https://github.com/melvincarvalho/" title="">Carvelho</a>, is now a leading developer and propotent of Nostr, another very interesting option which will be described later. This technology space is prolific, but still comparatively young and small.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>2.2 </span>Spatial web</h4>
<div id="Ch2.S2.p1">
<p id="Ch2.S2.p1.1">“The Spatial Web”, a blurring of the boundaries between digital and geospatial physical objects, seems to have developed from the strands in the original W3C scope around devices in the real world. It has been concentrating around AR and VR but is being marketed and amplified with the same references to availability of data (See Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F1" title="Figure 2.1 ‣ 2.2 Spatial web ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation &amp; The Web ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>2.1</span></a> from a Deloitte accounting report). This too is finding little traction in practice, though obviously the component technologies continue to enjoy rapid development. Nonetheless, this interpretation of Web3 becomes valuable when examining Metaverse later.</p></div>

<section id="Ch2.S3">
<h4>
<span>2.3 </span>Web3</h4>
<div id="Ch2.S3.p1">
<p id="Ch2.S3.p1.1">More recently Web3 is <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=web3" title="">being touted</a> as a way to connect content creators directly to content consumers, without centralised companies acting as gatekeepers of the data. It implies that all users have a cryptographic key management system, to which they attach metadata, that they make requirements of peers with whom they communicate, and that they maintain trust ‘scores’ with peers.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S3.p2">
<p id="Ch2.S3.p2.1">It seems likely that this new model is less driven by a market need, and more by the high availability of tools which allow this to happen (the ecosystems described later). Add to this a social response to the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-facebook-worst-company-of-the-year-yahoo-finance-165345819.html" title="">collapse in trust of companies such as Facebook</a> and other <a href="https://reb00ted.org/tech/20220727-end-of-social-networking/" title="">social media platforms</a><cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx4" title="">4</a>]</cite> (Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F2" title="Figure 2.2 ‣ 2.3 Web3 ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation &amp; The Web ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>2.2</span></a>). There is perhaps a wish by consumers to pass more of the economic incentive to content creators, without the ‘rent seeking’ layer afforded by businesses, and a healthy dose of mania driven market speculation. <a href="https://www.edelman.co.uk/sites/g/files/aatuss301/files/2022-01/2022%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer_UK.pdf" title="">Edelman’s latest trust report</a> is shocking, finding that trust in all institutions has slumped recently to all time lows, and their global survey found that: <span id="Ch2.S3.p2.1.1">“Nearly 6 in 10 say their default tendency is to distrust something until they see evidence it is trustworthy. Another 64% say it’s now to a point where people are incapable of having constructive and civil debates about issues they disagree on. When distrust is the default – we lack the ability to debate or collaborate.”</span></p></div>

<h5>
<span>2.3.1 </span>Emerging consensus</h5>
<div id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p1.1">The recent hype cycle ignored the legacy definitions described above and instead focusing almost exclusively on Ethereum based peer-to-peer projects. It can be seen that the description is somewhat in the eye of the beholder.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p2">
<p id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p2.1">It’s possible to frame this Ethereum Web3 as a hugely complex and inefficient digital rights management system (DRM). DRM is something that users of the internet are increasingly familiar and comfortable with. It’s somewhat debatable whether decentralising this is worthwhile. The thesis of the developers of the technology seems to be that without it, control of ‘value’ will accrete over time, to one or more hegemonic controlling entities. It’s a strong argument, but there is a <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html" title="">substantial counter argument</a> emerging that users just don’t want this stuff. The nervousness of legislators in the USA to the attempt by Facebook/Meta to enter this peer-to-peer value transmission space is telling in terms of the perception of who is driving Web3.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p3">
<p id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p3.1">Throughout 2022 there was much furore on the internet over what Web3 might be, and who it ‘serves’. Enthusiasts feel that products such as <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/" title="">Sign-In with Ethereum</a> (EIP-4361) might give users choice over their data sovereignty, and a meme to this effect is seen in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F3" title="Figure 2.3 ‣ 2.3.1 Emerging consensus ‣ 2.3 Web3 ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation &amp; The Web ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>2.3</span></a>. In practice though users are expecting to use badly written, buggy, economically vulnerable ‘crypto’ wallets to log into websites. The quality of this wallet software is improving of late with the so called “wallet wars” seeing commerce grade offerings from Coinbase and shares platform ‘Robinhood’. These two companies alone have over 100 million users. It’s likely that these wallets will evolve to offer the full spectrum of Web3 functionality. With that said it doesn’t seem to make much sense yet on the face of it. There are in fact examples of the technology completely failing at censorship resistance. Popular ‘Web3’ browser extension Metamask and NFT platform Opensea have both <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/03/03/iranian-venezuela-users-abruptly-dropped-from-major-crypto-platforms-as-russian-sanctions-grow/?sh=22bcabc470b0" title="">recently banned countries</a> in response to global sanction pressure. This failure to meaningfully decentralise will be explored further in the distributed identity section.</p></div>

<p id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p6.2">This list seems targeted toward the coming regulatory landscape, and could be considered at odds with the original tenants of an organically emergent, decentralised internet. Indeed principles such as ‘furthering sustainability goals’ seem downright incongruous. The community they claim to wish to support here are openly critical of these major institutional players and their motives, with even more pointed criticisms <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/" title="">coming from outside of the Web3</a>. This book and lab steer well clear of these companies and their applications.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p7">
<p id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p7.1">Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer of ‘Circle’ venture capital, said in testimony to a US senate hearing; that Web 1 was ‘read’, Web 2 was ‘read write’, and that Web 3 will ‘read write own’. The important takeaway here is not so much this oft quoted elevator pitch for Web3, but the fact that legislative bodies now consider this technology a force which they need to be aware of and <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/12/17/prediction-for-the-new-year-a-web3-midterm/" title="">potentially contend with</a>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p8">
<p id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p8.1">Jeremy Allaire, again of Circle’, talks about the recent legislative order in the USA as follows:
<span id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p8.1.1">“this is a watershed moment for crypto, digital assets, and Web 3, akin to the 1996/1997 whole of government wakeup to the commercial internet. The U.S. seems to be taking on the reality that digital assets represent one of the most significant technologies and infrastructures for the 21st century; it’s rewarding to see this from the WH after so many of us have been making the case for 9+ years.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p9">
<p id="Ch2.S3.SS1.p9.1">We will see in the following chapters that participation in this new Web3 is contingent on owning cryptocurrencies. <a href="https://www.finder.com/uk/cryptocurrency-statistics" title="">It’s estimated</a> that about 6% of people in the UK own some cryptocurrency, with skews to both younger demographics, and smaller holdings. The legislative landscape in the UK is comparatively strict with <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/perverse-impacts-anti-money-laundering-144239343.html" title="">questionable</a> “know your customer / anti money laundering” (KYC/AML) data collection <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/money-laundering-regulations-your-responsibilities" title="">mandated in law</a>. Users of UK exchanges must provide a great deal of personal financial information, and undertake to prove that the wallets they are withdrawing to are their own. From the perspective of the UK SME it seems this seriously limits the potential audience for new products. Europe meanwhile has recently voted through even more restrictive regulation, applying the “<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-an-economy-that-works-for-people/file-revision-of-the-regulation-on-transfers-of-funds" title="">transfer of funds regulation</a>” to all transactions coming out of exchanges, enforcing a database of all addresses between companies, and reporting transactions above 1000 Euros to authorities. They have narrowly avoided enforcing KYC on all transfers to private wallets, but have capped transactions at 1000 Euros. The recent <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/30/digital-finance-agreement-reached-on-european-crypto-assets-regulation-mica/" title="">“Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)</a> legislation imposes overheads that may make it harder for smaller businesses in the sector to operate within the EU, but is has been cautiously welcomed by established players (Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F5" title="Figure 2.5 ‣ 2.3.1 Emerging consensus ‣ 2.3 Web3 ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation &amp; The Web ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>2.5</span></a>, who have been hungry for clarity. It is certainly far short of the ‘ban’ seen in China, and the regulation be enforcement in the USA.</p></div>

It seems that this EU position has prompted the UK government to seize the potential competitive advantage offered, and there will be more on this later. Japan meanwhile has gone so far as to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/japanese-prime-minister-says-gov-t-investment-in-digital-transformation-will-include-metaverse-nfts" title="">make an announcement</a> about supporting the technologies at a national level.</p></div>

Subscribers use one of a variety of apps to stream micro-transactions of Bitcoin directly to the content creators as they listen to the podcast. No intermediate business takes a cut.

<span>2.4.4 </span>Distributed exchanges</h5>
<div id="Ch2.S4.SS4.p1">
<p id="Ch2.S4.SS4.p1.1">There are dozens of decentralised exchanges deployed on various blockchains. These platforms allow users to trade back and forth between various tokens (including ‘normal money’ stablecoins) and charge a fee for doing so. They operate within the logic of the smart contracts <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx5" title="">5</a>]</cite>, within the distributed blockchains. This makes them extremely hard to ban, and as a result they operate in a legal grey area. At the extreme end of this is “distributed apps” (dApps) and “Decentralised Finance” (DeFi) which allows users access to complex financial instruments without legal or privacy constraints. DeFi will be touched on briefly later.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S4.SS4.p2">
<p id="Ch2.S4.SS4.p2.1">This is a huge area, and of only limited interest to the topics expanded in this book. It’s perhaps worth noting <a href="https://bitcoin-dex.net/about/index.html" title="">BitcoinDEX</a>, which runs in JavaScript in a web browser. It is effectively uncensorable, <a href="https://bitcoin-dex.net/tokens.js" title="">auditable by the user</a>, and has no counter party risk since it operates entirely in the Bitcoin network. It is clearly an early prototype but manages this complex feature without the more expressive logic of more ‘modern’ public blockchains.</p></div>

<div id="Ch2.S4.SS5.p1">
<p id="Ch2.S4.SS5.p1.1">NFT markets are far more centralised services which match ‘owners’ of digital assets with potential buyers. The concept is a staple of the more recent interpretation of Web3, even though in practice these seem to be centralised concerns. <a href="https://opensea.io/" title="">Opensea</a> claims to be the largest decentralised NFT marketplace, but they have the ability to <a href="https://thedefiant.io/sad-frogs-delisted-opensea/" title="">remove listings</a> in response to legal challenges. This seems to fly in the face of Web3 principles.

<h5>
<span>2.4.6 </span>Non blockchain webs of trust</h5>
<div id="Ch2.S4.SS6.p1">
<p id="Ch2.S4.SS6.p1.1">New products like Slashtags and Nostr (covered later) use a web of trust decentralised peer-to-peer (ish) model which assigns metadata and trust scores to ‘any’ data and connection, with a security model rooted in the Bitcoin cryptographic ‘keys’ but crucially not the bitcoin network. This makes it interoperable with bitcoin but not reliant upon it. In principle this allows users to build complex networks of inherited trust bi-directionally with their networks over time. Every connection to a peer can be a new schema, with individual metadata managed by the user. These are new and have low adoption at this time. The user controls the source of the data and can allow them to be used by centralised services. This flips the authentication and data management paradigm of web around, putting the user in charge of their data. This is a familiar concept to the DID/SSI communities (described later) but with significant investment. As Slashtags and Nostr use keys as endpoints they act as a web of naming and routing, bypassing the existing web infrastructure of DNS. It is likely very complex to use in practice and will be revisited later. Slashtags is being paired with the <a href="https://hypercore-protocol.org/" title="">Hypercore protocol</a> for peer-to-peer data sharing, more specifically the ‘hole punching’ capability of the hypercore system which ensures connections through firewalls<cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx6" title="">6</a>]</cite>. The first application by the affiliated Hyperdivision team is an open source peer-to-peer live video streaming app called <a href="https://dazaar.com/" title="">Dazaar</a>. Once again, it’s not clear yet who wants or needs this bit-torrent style service.</p></div>

<div id="Ch2.S4.SS7.p1">
<p id="Ch2.S4.SS7.p1.1">There are many perceived problems with having centralised authorities for overseeing the database which translates between human readable internet names and the underlying machine-readable address notation. The databases which manage this globally are already somewhat distributed, and this distributed trust model is managed through a cryptographic chain of trust called DNSSEC which is capped by a somewhat <a href="https://www.iana.org/dnssec/ceremonies" title="">bizarre key ceremony</a> seen in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F6" title="Figure 2.6 ‣ 2.4.7 Distributed DNS applications ‣ 2.4 Example applications ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation &amp; The Web ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>2.6</span></a>.

The nature of this problem means that it either moves from control by ICANN, or it does not, and so far it has not, but there are many attempted, and somewhat mature attempts, at this difficult problem.

<span>2.6 </span>The common thread</h4>

<div id="Ch2.S6.p2">
<p id="Ch2.S6.p2.1">Overall then, perhaps the space is hype, and is certainly <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/" title="">rife with scams</a>. Fully 24% of projects in 2022 are <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-pump-and-dump-schemes/" title="">estimated to be built</a> as ‘pump and dump’ scams. The degree to which it even accomplishes decentralised trust is highly debatable, and meanwhile the limited numbers of Web3 and supporting crypto companies display lamentable cyber security practice themselves, creating <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tag/data-breaches/" title="">honeypots of personal data</a> from users of the ecosystem.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S6.p3">
<p id="Ch2.S6.p3.1">With that said the component parts necessary to deliver on the promise <span id="Ch2.S6.p3.1.1">do</span> exist. If there is to be no central controlling party(s) as in the Web 2 model then nothing can happen without a cryptographically secure underpinning, allowing digital data to be passed around without a prior arrangement.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S6.p4">
<p id="Ch2.S6.p4.1">The following chapter will describe how much has been done by computer scientists over the past decades to support that. From this base layer we also get the potential for secure and trust minimised identity management. This nascent field of distributed identity management is explained later. From distributed trust models we can see ‘trustless’ transmission of economic value. The ability to send value from one person to another person or service without a third party.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S6.p5">
<p id="Ch2.S6.p5.1">This whole area is ‘crypto’, which is increasingly seeping into the human consciousness, and saw an astonishing $30B of <a href="https://docsend.com/view/nrvsuae85a4dx3jz" title="">capital investment in 2021</a> alone. At time of writing the industry is an <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en" title="">over 1 trillion</a> dollar market.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S6.p6">
<p id="Ch2.S6.p6.1">All the new crypto technologies circling the Web3 narrative are bound tightly together, but there is currently very little meaningful value to be seen.</p></div>
<div id="Ch2.S6.p7">
<p id="Ch2.S6.p7.1">The rest of this book will focus on the trust and value transfer elements of this shift in internet technologies, and attempt to build a case for it’s use in decentralised, open source, collaborative mixed reality applications.

<h3>
<span>Chapter 3 </span>DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin</h3>
<div id="Ch3.p1">
<p id="Ch3.p1.1">Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a data structure distributed across multiple managing stakeholders. A subset of DLT is blockchain, which is a less efficient, immutable data structure with a slightly different trust model. Rauchs et al. of the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance provide a detailed taxonomy and conceptual framework <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx8" title="">8</a>]</cite>. It can be seen in their paper that the definitions are somewhat unclear in literature.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.p2">
<p id="Ch3.p2.1">DLT, and especially blockchain, are rapidly gaining ground in the public imagination, within financial technology companies (FinTech), and in the broader corporate world.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.p3">
<p id="Ch3.p3.1">The technology and the global legislative response are somewhat immature, and misapplications of both technologies are commonplace.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.p4">
<p id="Ch3.p4.1">Distributed trust models emerged from cryptography research in the 1970s when Merkle, Diffie, and Hellman at Stanford worked out how to <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/understanding-ec-diffie-hellman-9c07be338d4a" title="">send messages online</a> without a trusted third party <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx9" title="">9</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx10" title="">10</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.p5">
<p id="Ch3.p5.1">Soon after the 1980s saw the emergence of the cypherpunk activist movement, as a reaction to the emerging surveillance state <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx11" title="">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx12" title="">12</a>]</cite>, a topic which is expanded for this moment in a later chapter. These early computer scientists in the USA saw the intersectionality between information, computation, economics, and personal freedom <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx13" title="">13</a>]</cite>. Online discussion in the early nineties foresaw the emergence of trans-national digital markets, what would become the WWW <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx14" title="">14</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx15" title="">15</a>]</cite>. The issues of privacy and the exchange of digital value (digital / ecash) were of foremost importance within these discussions and while privacy was within reach thanks to <a href="https://www.openpgp.org/about/history/" title="">“public/private key pairs”</a>,
ecash proved to be a more difficult problem.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.p6">
<p id="Ch3.p6.1">Adam Back’s 1997 ‘hashcash’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx16" title="">16</a>]</cite> paved the way for later work by implementing the concept of what would become ‘proof of work’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx17" title="">17</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx18" title="">18</a>]</cite>. This was built upon by Dai <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx19" title="">19</a>]</cite>, Szabo <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx5" title="">5</a>]</cite>, Finney <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx20" title="">20</a>]</cite>, and Nakamoto amongst others. In all it took 16 years of collaboration on the mailing lists (and dozens of failed attempts) to attack the problem of trust-minimised, distributed, digital cash. The culmination of these attempts was Bitcoin <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx21" title="">21</a>]</cite>. This is illustrated by Dan Held in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F1" title="Figure 3.1 ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>3.1</span></a>.

<p id="Ch3.p9.1">In principle blockchains provide a <span id="Ch3.p9.1.1">differentiated trust model</span>. With a properly distributed system a blockchain can be considered “trust-minimised”, though certainly not risk minimised. This is important for some, but not all people. There is not much emboldening of text within this book. If you start to question the whole reason for this ‘global technology revolution’ then it always comes back to those three words. Put more crispy it’s been hiding in plain sight since 20008 as ‘Magic Internet Money’. Perhaps the lack of a trusted third party, and the potential for instant final settlement will be most important for machine to machine (AI) systems, and that is the primary focus of this book.</p></div>

<p id="Ch3.p10.1">It can be argued that the whole concept of distributed cryptographic blockchains is <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/reports/Unintended_Centralities_in_Distributed_Ledgers.pdf" title="">somewhat strained</a>, as the vast majority of the technology offerings are not distributed, and worse, meaningful distribution may indeed be practically impossible without a trusted third party <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx22" title="">22</a>]</cite>. “There are many scenarios where <a href="https://calpaterson.com/blockchain.html" title="">traditional databases</a> should be used instead”<cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx23" title="">23</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<span>3.1 </span>What’s this for sorry?</h4>
<div id="Ch3.S1.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S1.p1.1">The proponents of blockchains argue, that in an era when data breaches and corporate financial insolvency intersect with a collapse in trust of institutions, it is perhaps useful to have an alternative model for storage of data, and value. That seems like a lot of effort for a questionable gain. It’s far more likely it’s simply speculation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S1.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S1.p2.1">While writing this book the questions of ‘what is this <span id="Ch3.S1.p2.1.1">really for</span> and how can it possibly be worth it’, came up again and again. In truth it’s a very difficult question, without a clear enough answer. It’s beyond the scope of this book to figure this out properly, but references to advantages and disadvantages will be made throughout.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S1.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S1.p3.1">It seems that the engineers who created Bitcoin wanted very much to solve a technical problem they saw with money (from their understanding of it), and the transmission of money digitally. As the scale and scope have increased so has the <a href="https://medium.com/@nic__carter/visions-of-bitcoin-4b7b7cbcd24c" title="">narrative evolved</a> as seen in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F4" title="Figure 3.4 ‣ 3.1 What’s this for sorry? ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>3.4</span></a>, but it’s never really kept pace with the level of the questions posed.</p></div>

<p id="Ch3.S1.p4.1">A cost benefit analysis that excludes speculative gains seems to fail for pretty much all of blockchain/DLT.

<p id="Ch3.S1.p5.1">For the most developed defence of the technology as it stands in from a Western perspective, in this moment, Gladstein (<a href="https://www.financialinclusion.tech/" title="">and others</a>) offer a vision for the asset class, in the 87% of the world he says don’t have access to the technology infrastructure benefits enjoyed by the developed west <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx24" title="">24</a>]</cite> (Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F5" title="Figure 3.5 ‣ 3.1 What’s this for sorry? ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>3.5</span></a>).</p></div>

<p id="Ch3.S1.p7.1">Gladstein’s is a carefully developed and well researched book, but is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/imf-world-bank-repress-poor-countries" title="">written from the western perspective</a> of (just) Bitcoin ‘being the raft’. Later in this book we will consider if it might be the iceberg, but this is not the domain expertise we offer in this book. It is crucial to note that Gladstein has vociferous detractors within Africa. It seems entirely possible he’s another grifter as suggested by Kimani: <span id="Ch3.S1.p7.1.1">“Gladstein is a charlatan who makes his living by selling the image of a global south that is corrupt, entirely lacking in rational thinking and needing a saviour, like him to swoop in and save us from our floundering selves. He exploits on tired and unproven stereotypes, cherry picks data while ignoring mountains of evidence that disprove him. Because he knows that as the perceived “morally superior” “right thinking” western superior coming to save, he will mostly go unchallenged. It’s a grift, an old grift that many like him have turned into an industry. Where they earn tax free income by selling a delusion and fetish to their western audience who need to think the global south is a failure of the human experience. He is trying to set himself up as some gate keeper and king maker in the Global South. He knows that the next phase of growth is. So he wants to make sure that westerners looking to invest in the global south see him as some “expert” and ask for his unfounded opinions. People like him run global morality extortion rings. How so? Simple: By purporting to know and be the keeper of global south morality, he will use his words to bless or curse your business, well, unless you make a generous donation to his foundation. These are scare tactics employed by charlatans to run tax-evading PR entities, thinly veiled as “human rights” organisations. If you are not on his side, he will slander you and your organisation. If you ensure you promote him and his ambitions, he anoints you as the good guy! He is trying to play the role that the Vatican and other corrupt religious organisations played in the 1800. Turning morality into a commodity that can be purchased from his market place: We decide who is good and who is bad and who can do business and who can’t. For a “donation”. He is not the first and he will not be the last. It’s a growing industry, driven by shrewd westerners who know that they can sell racial stereotypes back home, but as long as they claim they are the one’s helping or saving the coloured peoples from themselves.”</span></p></div>

<div id="Ch3.S2.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S2.p1.1">Within DLT/blockchain there seem to be as many opinions on the value of the technology as there are implementations. A host of well engineered open source code repositories makes the cost of adoption relatively low.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S2.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S2.p2.1">There are thousands of different ‘chains’ and many more tokens which represent value on them. A majority of these are code forks of earlier projects. Most <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/deadcoins/" title="">are defunct</a> yet still have some residual ‘value’ locked up in them as a function of their ‘distributed’ tokens.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S2.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S2.p3.1">Because the space is comparatively new, subject to <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/call-evidence-dlt-pilot-regime" title="">scant regulation</a>, and often open source, it is possible to clone a github, change a few lines of code, and front it with a website in order to create ‘scams’, and this happens frequently <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx25" title="">25</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>3.3 </span>Ethereum</h4>
<div id="Ch3.S3.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S3.p1.1">Ethereum <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx26" title="">26</a>]</cite> is the second most <a href="https://www.crypto51.app/" title="">secure</a> public blockchain (<a href="https://howmanyconfs.com/" title="">by about 50%</a>)<cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx27" title="">27</a>]</cite>, and second most valuable by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" title="">market capitalisation</a> (though this comparison is somewhat stretched). It is the natural connection from Web3 to the rest of the book, so it will be considered first.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S3.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S3.p2.1">It is touted as ‘programmable money’. It, unlike bitcoin, is (<a href="https://hackernoon.com/turing-completeness-and-the-ethereum-blockchain-c5a93b865c1a" title="">nearly</a>) Turing complete <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx28" title="">28</a>]</cite>, able to run a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/" title="">virtual machine</a> within the distributed network (albeit slowly), and can therefore process complex transactional contracts in the settlement of value. This has given rise to the new field of ‘distributed finance’, or DeFi (described later), alongside many interesting trust-minimised immutable ledger public database ideas.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S3.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S3.p3.1">There are trade-offs and problems with Ethereum (Eth/Ether) which currently increase the ‘participation floor’ and make the network far less suitable for entry level business-to-business use. The ledger itself being a computational engine, with write only properties, is enormous. Specialist cloud hardware is required to run a full node (copy of the ledger), and partial nodes are the norm. Many partial nodes are run by one specialist cloud provider (<a href="https://consensys.net/blog/news/why-infura-is-the-secret-weapon-of-ethereum-infrastructure/" title="">Infura</a>), which has recently been forced to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metamask-infura-block-certain-areas-173749914.html" title="">exclude Venezuela</a> from the network. Network validators are <a href="https://mevwatch.info/" title="">refusing to process</a> addresses on an <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information" title="">OFAC sanction list</a>. A staggering 58% runs on <a href="https://ethernodes.org/networkType/Hosting" title="">Amazon AWS servers</a>. Critics of the project point to these vulnerabilities to outside influence as an existential threat to the aims of the technology. If it can be censured, then what advantage is there over the <a href="https://protos.com/consensys-lawsuit-jpmorgan-owns-critical-ethereum-infrastructure/" title="">founders</a> simply running a high speed database to the same purpose?</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S3.p4">
<p id="Ch3.S3.p4.1">This is a function of the so called ‘scalability trilema’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx29" title="">29</a>]</cite>, in which it seems that only two features from the list of decentralization, scalability or security can be chosen for blockchains <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx30" title="">30</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S3.p5">
<p id="Ch3.S3.p5.1">Moreover the network is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ethereum-is-coercive-bitcoin-is-not" title="">centrally controlled</a> by its creator and the ‘miners’. There is a strong case to answer that Eth is <a href="https://blog.mollywhite.net/blockchains-are-not-what-they-say/" title="">neither distributed</a>, nor trustless, and in fact therefore fails to be differentiated from a DLT, undermining some of it’s claims. The history of Ethereum is a fascinating case study in human greed. By the time the whitepaper had it’s first limited release, Bitcoin (covered next) had already passed $1000 per token. This led to the creators ambitions for a ‘fair release’ of tokens being voted down by powerful funders, leading to the explosion of similarly structured ‘pre-mined’ coins in the ICO craze, which followed on the Ethereum network. Laura Shin is possibly the most experienced journalist and author in the space and has covered this crazy era in her book ‘The Cryptopians’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx31" title="">31</a>]</cite>. It’s a tough read for the newcomer though, perhaps finish this primer first!</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S3.p6">
<p id="Ch3.S3.p6.1">With that said there are many talented developers doing interesting work on the platform, and innovation is fast paced. It is entirely normal for technology projects to launch their distributed ledger idea on and within the Ethereum network. These generate tradable ‘ERC-20’ tokens, which can accrue value or demonstrate smart contract utility (based on the <a href="https://soliditylang.org/" title="">Solidity</a> programming language). Because the value locked and generated in the Ethereum platform comes not just from the ETH token, but all the ERC technologies built upon it, there are hundreds of billions of pounds ‘within’ the network. All of these projects, and indeed the core technology of Ethereum are subject to exploits and vulnerabilities and tens of billions of pounds have been lost <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx32" title="">32</a>]</cite>. Most of this money is pure market speculation (as is the case across blockchains). Many analysts cannot see this as anything but a speculative bubble, with all the predictable crash yet to come. This can be seen in the context of other bubbles in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F11" title="Figure 3.11 ‣ 3.3 Ethereum ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>3.11</span></a>. It seems that most of the projects in crypto more generally, but certainly with ETH and the NFTs within it are a new kind of social gambling, where online communities can reinforce groupthink around their speculative choices. This idea that Ethereum is not a commodity, but rather a security, built around promises of returns, is finding recent favour in law. New York attorney general James has alleged that Ether is a security in <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/Myyp0yz/kucoin-pdf#page=11" title="">court proceedings</a>, which could have enormous consequences, potentially reversing the momentum the asset had been enjoying as a commodity. Jason Lowery of MIT and US Space Force <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery/status/1572275617344757760" title="">lays out</a> a very clear thesis on the difference between Natamoto consensus and most of what followed as part of his PhD <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx33" title="">33</a>]</cite>. His explanation here is proximal to why we focus on Bitcoin, and dismiss ‘proof of stake’ models, though Lowery himself has very serious detractors such as Voskuil who has been working on these problems for a long time <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx34" title="">34</a>]</cite></p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S3.p7">
<p id="Ch3.S3.p7.1"><span id="Ch3.S3.p7.1.1">“The innovation behind PoW is precisely the fact that it <span id="Ch3.S3.p7.1.1.1">doesn’t</span> rely exclusively on software (an abstraction) to keep the ledger systemically secure, but instead incorporates real-world physics (watts) to impose real-world physical constraints on people/computers who run it. Stake is an abstraction. It is an imaginary way to describe the complex emergent behaviour of a bunch of general-purpose state machines. The state machines may physically exist, but the way you choose to visualize the complex emergent behaviour of those machines is imaginary. Satoshi didn’t couple control authority over ledger to abstract, imaginary things like ‘stake’ or ‘coin’ precisely because these things don’t physically exist. If they don’t physically exist, they are incapable of imposing real-world physical costs on people seeking control of ledger. The real-world physical cost of controlling the ledger is what keeps control over the ledger decentralized. It is too physically expensive (in watts) to gain and maintain centralized control over the BTC ledger. In proof of stake, there is no physical cost of gaining centralized control. Why? Because stake doesn’t physically exist. So all it takes to gain centralized control is majority stake. And once you have it (which, because of math, some combination of people already do), you have it forever.</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S3.p8">

<div id="Ch3.S3.p9">
<p id="Ch3.S3.p9.1">Such is the level of nefarious activity on these networks (within Ethereum) that they have a poor reputation, and are difficult to audit, launch, and maintain. The overriding problem of using a blockchain for utility applications (rather than just as money) is that people can, and will, simply lie for criminal purpose when entering data into the ledger. It is far more likely that Ethereum is simply a speculative bubble than any of the claims for utility being born out. Add to that <a href="https://advisor.morganstanley.com/daron.edwards/documents/field/d/da/daron-edwards/Cryptocurrency_201__What_is_Ethereum_.pdf" title="">Morgan Stanleys recent assertion</a> that Ethereum is itself threatened by newer contender chains and it’s future becomes unclear. The report correctly identifies that “High transaction fees create scalability problems and threaten user demand. High costs make Ethereum too expensive for small-value transactions.”. It is this high cost of use that most excludes the ERC-20 networks from our consideration.</p></div>
<section id="Ch3.S3.SS1">
<h5>
<span>3.3.1 </span>Gas fees</h5>
<div id="Ch3.S3.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S3.SS1.p1.1">Ethereum has a significant barrier to entry because of high fees to use the network. The system is Turing complete; able to programatically replicate any other computational system. This includes endless loops in code, so it is trivial to lock up the computational bandwidth of the whole system, in a smart contract commitment, through a web wallet.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S3.SS1.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S3.SS1.p2.1">To mitigate this existential ‘denial of service attack’ the ‘gas’ system demands that users spend some of their locked up value to operate on the network. In this way a transaction loop would quickly erode the available gas and stop looping. As the popularity of the system has grown, so too have the gas fees. It can <a href="https://twitter.com/Blockworks_/status/1521071340517830657" title="">sometimes cost</a> over £10,000 to do a single transaction, though it is typically a few tens of pounds. Appallingly if the user pitches their mining fee offer too low, then the money gets spent anyway! <a href="https://fees.wtf/#/" title="">A website</a> just plucks random Ethereum addresses out of the aether to show you the level of this expense for participants. People can even <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fees-wtf-nft?search%5BsortAscending%5D=false&amp;search%5BsortBy%5D=PRICE" title="">buy NFTs</a> of the worst examples of these, as ‘tokens’, wasting more money. This is a huge problem for potential uses of the network.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>3.3.2 </span>Ether ultra hard money narrative</h5>
<div id="Ch3.S3.SS2.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S3.SS2.p1.1">Part of the challenge Ethereum faces is wrapped up with it’s complex token emission schedule. This is the rate at which tokens are generated and ‘burnt’ or destroyed in the network. The total supply of tokens is uncertain, and both emission and burn schedules are regularly tinkered with by the project. The changes to the rate at which ETH are generated can be seen in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F12" title="Figure 3.12 ‣ 3.3.2 Ether ultra hard money narrative ‣ 3.3 Ethereum ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>3.12</span></a>.

<figcaption><span>Figure 3.12: </span>The rate of token generation has changed unpredictably over time. Rights requested</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="Ch3.S3.SS2.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S3.SS2.p2.1">In addition, a recent upgrade (EIP-1559) results in tokens now being burnt at a higher rate than they are produced, deliberately leading to a diminishing supply. In theory this increases the value of each ETH on the network at around 1% per year. It’s very complex, with impacts on transaction fees, waiting time, and consensus security, as examined by Liu at al. <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx35" title="">35</a>]</cite>. Additionally, there is now talk (by <a href="https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/" title="">Butlerin</a>, the creator of Ethereum) of extending this burn mechanism <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/multidimensional-eip-1559/11651" title="">further into the network</a>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S3.SS2.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S3.SS2.p3.1">Ethereum was designed from the beginning to move to a ‘proof of stake’ model where token holders underpin network consensus through complex automated voting systems based upon their token holding. This is now called <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/" title="">Ethereum Consensus Layer</a>. This recent ‘Merge’ upgrade has reduced the carbon footprint of the network, a laudable thing, though it seems the GPUs and datacentres have just gone on to be elsewhere. It has not lowered the cost to users nor improved performance. As part of the switching roadmap users were asked to lock up 32ETH tokens each (a substantial allocation of capital). In total there are around 14 million of these tokens, and it is those users who now control the network. This money is likely stuck on the network until at least 2024, a significant delay wen compared to the original promises.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S3.SS2.p4">
<p id="Ch3.S3.SS2.p4.1">This means that proof of stake has problems in that the majority owners ‘decide’ the truth of the chain to a degree, and must by design have the ability to over-ride prior consensus choices. Remember that these users are now trapped in their positions. Four major entities now control the rules of the chain, and have already agreed to censor certain banned addressees. Proof of stake is probably inherently broken <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx36" title="">36</a>]</cite>. This has <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd" title="">f</a>or malicious actors who have sufficient control of the existing history of the chain, <a href="https://twitter.com/MTorgin/status/1521433474820890624" title="">thought to be</a> in the region of $50M <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx37" title="">37</a>]</cite>. Like much of the rest of ‘crypto’ the proposed changes will concentrate decisions and economic rewards in the hands of major players, early investors, and incumbents. This is a far cry from the stated aims of the technology. The move to proof of stake has recently earned it the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/23/1044960/proof-of-stake-cryptocurrency/" title="">MIT breakthrough technology award</a>, despite not being complete (validators cannot yet sell their voting stakes). It’s clearly a technology which is designed to innovate at the expense of predictability. This might work out very well for the platform, but right now the barrier to participation (in gas fees) is so high that we do not intend for Ethereum to be in scope as a method for value transfer within metaverses.</p></div>

<p id="Ch3.S4.p6.1">Digital scarcity is incredibly important and is explained well by software engineer Hillibrand in a podcast (this text is paraphased: <span id="Ch3.S4.p6.1.1">“Digital scarcity is an interesting concept that was well explained by German economist Guido Hülsmann in his book “The Ethics of Money Production,” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx46" title="">46</a>]</cite> published in 2007. Hülsmann stated that an economic good that is defined entirely in terms of bits and bytes is unlikely ever to be produced spontaneously on a free market, and at the time, he was right. However, the emergence of Bitcoin would soon prove that digital scarcity could indeed be achieved. Hülsmann noted that an economic good must be scarce and rivalrous, meaning there is a potential for conflict over who can utilize the resource. For example, air is abundant but still considered scarce as its availability can be limited in specific situations, leading to conflicts over its use. The concept of digital scarcity is built on the idea that information, which is fundamentally not scarce, can be made scarce through specific mechanisms. Bitcoin, for instance, addresses the double-spending problem, where a digital token could be spent more than once, by establishing a decentralized network that prevents the same coin from being used in multiple transactions. Nakamoto devised a system that allows users to establish scarcity and rivalrousness in cyberspace without relying on a single trusted third party. Instead of relying on a central authority, like a government, to determine the validity of transactions, Bitcoin relies on a network of computers known as “full nodes” that verify and enforce a set of rules. This decentralized system enables the creation of digital goods that are both scarce and rivalrous, which was previously thought to be impossible.”</span></p></div>

It is a singular event in that it became established at scale, such that it could be seen to be a fully distributed system, without a controlling entity.

<h6>Mining process overview</h6>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p1.1">Bitcoin mining is the process of adding public transactions into the ledger, in return for two economic rewards, paid in Bitcoin. These are the mining fee, and the block reward. The transactions which are added into the next ‘block’ of the chain are selected preferentially based on the fee they offer, which is up to the user trying to get their transaction into the chain. This can be within the next 10 minutes (next block), or a gamble out toward ’never’ depending how competitive the network is at any time. Miners try to find a sufficiently low result from a cryptographic hash function <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx53" title="">53</a>]</cite>(a random process), and upon finding it, they can take their pre-prepared ‘block’ of transactions sourced from their local queue (mempool), and add it into the chain, for confirmation by other miners. In return they take all the fees within that mined block, and whatever the block reward is at the time. When the network started the block reward was 50 Bitcoin, but has <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/dissecting-code-bitcoin-halving/" title="">halved</a> repeatedly every 210,000 blocks (four years) and now stands at 6.25 BTC. The rate of mining is kept roughly at one block every 10 minutes, by a difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks (2 weeks). This in a complex interdependent mechanism and is explained very well in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-mining-protects-the-bitcoin-network" title="">this article</a>. These components are explained in slightly more detail later.</p></div>

<p id="Ch3.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p3.1">At the end of 2022 it is thought to be the case that the only profitable miners are the large scale companies who are also providing load balancing services to energy companies. This is unusual in the history of mining, and the situation will likely change over time.
This is not to say that all mining is, or should be, so concentrated. Anyone running the hashing algorithm can <a href="https://twitter.com/ckpooldev/status/1485585814419812356" title="">get lucky</a> and claim the block reward. PoW ties the value of the ‘money’ component of Bitcoin directly to energy production. This is not a new idea.

Then when we get to peak period times they are very quick to remove themselves from the market as prices increases The fact that we can turn down whenever we need the power for other customers is fantastic. We can use that crypto currency to soak up that excess generation when there’s a lot of that, and find a home for more solar and more wind to come to our grid. Then they reduce consumption when we need that power for other customers. So it’s a great balancing act. Most other datacenters [such as] Microsoft or Amazon have other customers to serve every other day, so they can’t just turn off. But these crypto customers can. If the cost of energy gets too high they can remove themselves from the market. They are also helpful if we lose a generator.

The facility has been completed by Cumulus Data, a subsidiary of independent power producer Talon Energy. Talon Energy owns the adjacent 2.5 GW Nuclear Power Plant and has been dabbling in Bitcoin mining for some time, opening a zero carbon Bitcoin mining facility in collaboration with Terawolf in August 2021. The new facility will operate with a maximum capacity of 48 MW, drawing on excess power from the nuclear plant. By locating the mining facility on the combined 1200 acre campus, there is no intermediation by legacy electric transmission and distribution utilities, as the mining is directly connected to the power station. Cumulus Data is in the process of building two additional 48 MW facilities and has identified 18 additional Talon Energy sites with potential to host data centres directly connected to electricity generation infrastructure. In general, there is a shift in attitudes towards nuclear in the US. The enormous benefit to this model stems from the cots associated with scaling down atomic power output to match grid requirements. By co-locating in this way the reactor can work at highest efficiency all the time, and can earn money from the generation of Bitcoin when the grid is unable to accept the energy. It is increasingly possible to find excited talk about funding smaller more pragmatic nuclear power plants using the cost benefits of the Bitcoin mining model, though this remains untested.</p></div>

For this use the price must simply be high enough to ensure that mining viably secures the network. This security floor is unfortunately a ‘known unknown’.

In an era where AI actors perform tasks on behalf of humans in digital realms such as cyberspace, these AI actors will require a reliable and efficient means of transaction. AI agents can perform, transact and negotiate, and execute work contracts in near real-time. For this use, the primary requirement is not a high token price, but rather a high level of network security and scalability that can support an enormous volume of transactions. The Lightning Network of Bitcoin might be a starting point but the robustness of the system, against potential AI exploits, is yet to be confirmed. As AI systems become more complex and autonomous, there is an increasing need for decentralized AI governance mechanisms that can prevent the concentration of power and ensure ethical AI development and deployment. Bitcoin can serve as a basis for this, providing a decentralized, transparent, and immutable record of AI decisions and actions. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism could potentially be adapted to enforce AI adherence to agreed-upon rules or norms. In this context, Bitcoin’s value extends beyond its token price and into its potential contributions to AI governance and ethics. This is Bitcoin as an AI economy.</p></div>

Bitcoin’s open-source nature allows for the integration of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, safeguarding it against quantum threats. In this sense, investment in Bitcoin might also be seen as an investment in a future-proof monetary network. This assertion depends on the assumption that Bitcoin’s protocol will adapt in time to incorporate such cryptographic advances before quantum computing becomes a real threat to its integrity. The practical implementation of these technologies might see a shift in the network’s dynamics - the hash rate, mining cost, and token value.</p></div>

This refers to the value that could have been generated if the resources invested in a particular activity had been utilised elsewhere. In the context of Bitcoin, this includes the investments made in mining equipment, power, facilities, and the hiring of skilled personnel to maintain the operations. The sunk opportunity cost of Bitcoin can be substantial. It can be argued that the value of Bitcoin must take this cost into consideration, as the resources could have been allocated to other productive sectors or investments <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx68" title="">68</a>]</cite>. Of course, there remains the infamous sunk cost fallacy, which refers to the tendency of individuals or organizations to continue investing in a project or decision based on the amount of resources already spent, rather than evaluating the current and future value of the investment. This indeed tends to lead to a cyclical boom and bust dynamic in the industrial mining communities. The ultimate fallacy would occur if miners or investors continued to invest in mining equipment and operations solely because of the resources that have already been spent on them, and the asset simply crashes to nothing from here. It’s a shaky justification because it assumes the future is the same as the past.</p></div>

It’s worth picking out the conclusion of that section verbatim: <span id="Ch3.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p20.1.1">“Innovation in financial services brings both risks and opportunities for the broader economy. It can challenge business models and existing industries, but it cannot challenge basic economic principles, such as what makes an asset effective as money and the incentives that give rise to run risk. Although the underlying technologies are a clever solution for the problem of how to execute transactions without a trusted authority, crypto assets currently do not offer widespread economic benefits. They are largely speculative investment vehicles and are not an effective alternative to fiat currency. Also, they are too risky at present to function as payment instruments or to expand financial inclusion. Even so, it is possible that their underlying technology may still find productive uses in the future as companies and governments continue to experiment with DLT. In the meantime, some crypto assets appear to be here to stay, and they continue to cause risks for financial markets, investors, and consumers. Much of the activity in the crypto asset space is covered by existing regulations and regulators are expanding their capabilities to bring a large number of new entities under compliance (SEC 2022). Other parts of the crypto asset space require coordination by various agencies and deliberations about how to address the risks they pose (U.S. Department of the Treasury 2022a). Certain innovations, such as FedNow and a potential U.S. CBDC, could help bring the U.S. financial infrastructure into the digital era in a clear and simple way, without the risks or irrational exuberance brought by crypto assets. Hence, continued investments in the Nation’s financial infrastructure have the potential to offer significant benefits to consumers and businesses, but regulators must apply the lessons that civilization has learned, and thus rely on economic principles, in regulating crypto assets.”</span></p></div>

This is most notable in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/05/02/cost-of-cryptomining-dame-tax/" title="">White House proposal</a> to tax Bitcoin mining at 30%, a plan which will destroy much of the US based mining industry over the coming years. Carter provides a <a href="https://medium.com/@nic__carter/comments-on-the-white-house-report-on-the-climate-implications-of-crypto-mining-8d65d30ec942" title="">detailed response</a> to the tardy scientific analysis in the report. Perhaps most interestingly it notes the potential of methane mitigation as mentioned earlier. It is conceivable that methane mitigation alone could provide a route forward for the technology. The report says:
<span id="Ch3.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p22.1.1">“The crypto-asset industry can potentially use stranded methane gas, which is the principal component of natural gas, to generate electricity for mining. Methane gas is produced during natural gas drilling and transmission, and by oil wells, landfills, sewage treatment, and agricultural processes. Methane is a potent GHG that can result in 27 to 30 times the global warming potential of CO2 over a 100-year time frame, and is about 80 times as powerful as CO2 over a 20-year timeframe. Reducing methane emissions can slow near-term climate warming, which is why the Biden-Harris Administration released the U.S. methane emissions reduction action plan in 2021. Venting and flaring methane at oil and natural gas wells wastes 4% of global methane production. In 2021, venting and flaring methane emitted the equivalent of 400 million metric tons of CO2, representing about 0.7% of global GHG emissions. This methane is vented or flared, because of the high cost of constructing permanent pipelines or electricity transmission that could transport the methane or its potential electricity generation from remote oil and gas operations to end-users, or because of the high cost of installing equipment on older landfills. Crypto-asset companies are now exploring ways to use electricity generation from vented and flared methane at oil and gas wells and at landfills.
While the EPA and the Department of the Interior have proposed new rules to reduce methane for oil and natural gas operations, crypto-asset mining operations that capture vented methane to produce electricity can yield positive results for the climate, by converting the potent methane to CO2 during combustion. Mining operations that replace existing methane flares would not likely affect CO2 emissions, since this methane would otherwise be flared and converted to CO2. Mining operations, though, could potentially be more reliable and more efficient at converting methane to CO2. While such operations can reduce wasted methane, another option is low-cost recovery of methane using existing vapor capture technologies at oil and gas wells, which can reduce global methane emissions up to 50% by 2030.”</span></p></div>

<p id="Ch3.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p23.1">The EU has just voted to add the whole of ‘crypto’, including PoW, to the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities. This EU wide classification system provides investors with guidance as to the sustainability of a given technology, and can have a meaningful impact on the flows of investment. With that said the report and addition of PoW is not slated until 2025, and it is by no means clear what the analysis will be by that point. Meanwhile they’re tightening controls of transactions, on which there will be more detail later. For it’s part the European Central Bank has come out <span>in favour of strong constraints</span> on crypto mining. They use the <a href="https://medium.com/crescofin/the-reports-of-bitcoin-environmental-damage-are-garbage-5a93d32c2d7" title="">widely discredited</a> “digiconimist” estimates to assert that mining operations are <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_3~d9614ea8e6.en.html" title="">disproportionately damaging to the environment</a>.</p></div>

The central bank of India is <a href="http://164.100.24.220/loksabhaquestions/annex/179/AS10.pdf" title="">strongly in favour</a> of a complete ban. Ajay Seth, secretary of the Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs recently said <span id="Ch3.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p25.1.1">“We have gone through a deep dive consulting with not just the domestic and institutional stakeholders but also organizations like IMF and World Bank….

<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.p1.1">This section could be far more detailed, but this is pretty complex stuff. Instead, there’s plenty of <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook" title="">books and websites</a> that do a more thorough job, if the reader is interested. Each subsection will include a good external link where more depth can be found. This whistle stop tour of the main components of the protocol should provide enough grounding, but it’s not essential reading for non technical readers.</p></div>

<h6>ECDSA / SHA256 / secp256k1</h6>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p1.1">These technologies tend to use the same underpinning <a href="https://curves.ulfheim.net/" title="">elliptic curve cryptography</a>, and it makes sense to unpack this here just once, only in the context of Bitcoin, as this will be the main focus of our attention.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p2.1">Public keys are a huge number used in conjunction with an algorithm to encrypt data. This allows a remote party to interact with an actor on the network whose private keys can decrypt that same data.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p3.1">In Bitcoin the ECDSA algorithm is used on the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1" title="">secp256k1</a> elliptic function to create a trapdoor. This (essentially) one way mathematical operation was originally the “discrete log problem” and part of the research in cryptography by Diffie and Hellman <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx9" title="">9</a>]</cite>. This is what binds the public and private keys in a key pair (the foundation of the whole space).</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p4">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p4.1">In their mathematical construct a modulus operator creates an infinite number of possible variations on operations which multiply enormous exponential numbers together, in different orders, to create key pairs. In order to reverse back through the ‘trapdoor’ a probably impossible number of guesses would have to be applied.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p5">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p5.1">Latterly, elliptic curves such as the secp256k1 curve used in Bitcoin have substantially simplified the computation problems. Rather than exponentials used by Diffie Helmman instead a repeated operation is applied to an elliptic curve function, and this itself creates a discrete log problem trapdoor in maths, far more efficiently. Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F23" title="Figure 3.23 ‣ ECDSA / SHA256 / secp256k1 ‣ 3.4.3 Technical overview ‣ 3.4 Bitcoin ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>3.23</span></a> suggests how this works.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p6">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p6.1">This makes it easier, faster, and cheaper to provide secure key pairs on basic computational resources. Elliptic curve solutions are not <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/" title="">‘provably’ secure</a> <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx70" title="">70</a>]</cite> in the same way as the Diffie-Hellman approach, and the security of this system is very sensitive to the randomness which is applied to the operation. Aficionados of Bitcoin use dice rolls or <a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/alex-waltz-s-quantum-random-number-generator-for-bitcoin-uses-radioactive-decay-and-a-raspberry-pi-25a75316220f" title="">even more exotic</a> means to add entropy (randomness) when creating keys. This really isn’t necessary, the software does this well enough.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p7">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx1.p7.1">ECDSA has already been replaced by the more efficient Schnorr signature method <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx71" title="">71</a>]</cite> which uses the same mathematical curve so is backward compatible. This will take some time for organic adoption, and ECDSA will never be deprecated.</p></div>

<h6>Addresses &amp; UTXOs</h6>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx3.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx3.p1.1">Ethereum has addresses which transactions flow in and out of. This is synonymous to a bank account number and so makes intuitive sense to users of banks. This is not the case in Bitcoin.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx3.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx3.p2.1">Bitcoin is a UTXO model blockchain. UTXO stands for unspent transaction output, and these are ‘portions’ of Bitcoin created and destroyed as value changes hands (through the action of cryptographic keys). They are the basis of the evolving ledger. This process is described well by Rajarshi Maitra in <a href="https://medium.com/bitbees/what-the-heck-is-utxo-ca68f2651819" title="">this post</a>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx3.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx3.p3.1"><span id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx3.p3.1.1">“Every Transaction input consists of a pointer and an unlocking key. The pointer points back to a previous transaction output. And the key is used to unlock the previous output it points to. Every time an output is successfully unlocked by an input, it is marked inside the blockchain database as ‘spent’. Thus you can think of a transaction as an abstract “action” that defines unlocking some previous outputs, and creating new outputs.
<br>These new outputs can again be referred by a new transaction input. A UTXO or ‘Unspent Transaction Output’ is simply all those outputs, which are yet to be unlocked by an input.
<br>Once an output is unlocked, imagine they are removed from circulating supply and new outputs take their place. Thus the sum of the value of unlocked outputs will be always equal to the sum of values of newly created outputs (ignoring transaction fees for now) and the total circulating supply of bitcoins remains constant.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx3.p4">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx3.p4.1">Fresh UTXOs are created as coinbase transactions, rewarded to miners who successfully mine a block. These can be spent to multiple output as normal. This is how the supply increases over time.</p></div>

<h6>Bitcoin script and miniscript</h6>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx4.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx4.p1.1">A Bitcoin script is a short chunk of code written into each transaction which gives conditions for the next UTXO transfer (spend). Bitcoin script is a programming language invented by Satoshi Nakamoto as part of the Bitcoin system. It’s a stack-based language, similar to reverse Polish notation, used to encode transactions and specify the conditions under which a Bitcoin address can be spent. Bitcoin script has 256 op codes, some of which are deprecated or can cause the program to fail.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx4.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx4.p2.1">Miniscript is a higher-level language that makes it easier to write robust Bitcoin smart contracts on chain. It smooths out the rough edges of Bitcoin script and makes it more accessible for non-technical users to understand and use. Miniscript provides a more intuitive way to specify spending conditions, making it easier for users to create smart contracts without needing to be an expert in programming languages like Rust or C++. Miniscript takes the basket of 256 op codes in Bitcoin script and simplifies them, making the most commonly used op codes more accessible and usable for average users. The <a href="https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/" title="">limited scripting language</a> and the features built into wallets on top, allow for some clever additional options beside receiving and spending. In fact, some of the more innovative features such as discrete log contracts (detailed later) are quite powerful, and can interact with the outside world. Scripts allow spends to be contingent on multiple sets of authorising keys, time locks into the future, or both.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx4.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx4.p3.1">Time locks can be either block height-based or wall time-based, but Miniscript ensures that the user has to choose one or the other within a single Bitcoin script. This is because some of the time lock opcodes like "check lock time verify" (CLTV) and "op sequence verify" change their behavior based on whether the code is four or five bytes long. Miniscript removes these quirks by providing a unified and more intuitive way to write smart contracts. An example of Miniscript’s functionality is a decaying multi-sig where a five of five multi-sig can be changed over time to a four or five multi-sig, or a three of five multi-sig, in case one or two keys are lost. This provides the user with more control and flexibility over their money and allows for contingencies in case of loss events. Additionally, Miniscript enables users to have <a href="https://bitcoindevkit.org/bdk-cli/playground/" title="">more control over their funds</a> by setting rules when money is put into a Bitcoin address, as well as allowing for corporate governance situations. Miniscript can also be used for inheritance planning, where a child’s key can be made to activate after a certain number of blocks have passed, creating a "dead man switch" functionality on the chain.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx4.p4">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx4.p4.1">Overall, Miniscript enables users to have more control and flexibility over their funds, making Bitcoin smart contracts more robust and secure, but it’s important to note that this is new technology and not yet integrated into user wallets.</p></div>

This ‘controlled supply’ feature was added to emulate the growth of physical asset stocks through mining.

<h6>Difficulty adjustment</h6>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx6.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx6.p1.1">The difficult adjustment (also mentioned earlier) shifts the difficulty of the mining algorithm globally to re-target one new block every 10 minutes. This means that adding a glut of new mining equipment will increase the issuance of Bitcoins, in favour of the new mining entity, for up to 2 weeks, at which point the difficulty increases, the schedule resets, and the advantage to the new miner is diffused. Equally this protects the network against significant loss of global mining hashrate, as happened when China comprehensively banned mining. Again, this is explained in <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty" title="">more detail</a> elsewhere.</p></div>

<h6>Wallets, seeds, keys and BIP39</h6>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx8.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx8.p1.1">In all the cryptographic systems described in this book everything is derived from a private key. This is an enormous number, and the input to the trapdoor function described earlier. As usual, it’s beyond the scope of this book to ‘rehash’ the detail. Prof Bill Buchanan OBE has a <a href="https://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/can-i-derive-the-private-key-from-the-public-key-ba3609256ec" title="">great post</a> on the basic version of this process.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx8.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx8.p2.1">In modern wallets, private keys (and so too their public keys), and addresses, are generated hierarchically. This is all part of <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki" title="">BIP-0032</a>. It starts with a single <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=2%5E512" title="">monstrously large</a> number of up to 512 bits. From this are crafted Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets, which use ‘derivation paths’ to make a tree of public/private key pairs, all seeded from this first number. This means that knowing the initial number, and the derivation path applied to it (just another number), wallets can search down the tree of derivations and find all the possible addresses. In this way a whole group of active addresses belonging to an entity can be held conveniently in one huge number (a concatenation of the input and path). This is the seed. Seeds are even more conveniently abstracted into a mnemonic called a seed phrase. Anyone interacting with these systems will see a 12 word (128 bits of entropy which is considered to be <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1433375602808066049" title="">‘enough’</a>) or 24 word (256 bit) seed phrase. That phrase accesses the whole of the assets stored by that entity in the blockchain under it. A master key. These seeds can be <a href="https://vault12.com/securemycrypto/cryptocurrency-security-how-to/dice-crypto-recovery-seed/" title="">generated by hand</a> with dice, remember it’s just a huge number and the onward cryptography at play here.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx8.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx8.p3.1">An address in Bitcoin is derived from the public/private key pair. Again this is a one way hash function. The public/private keys can’t be found from the address. Addresses are really only a thing in wallets. They contain the element necessary to interact with the UTXOs. Many UTXOs can reside under an address, in that they just share the same keys. Wallets and nodes can monitor the blockchain to see transactions that ‘belong’ to addresses owned by the wallet, then they can perform unlocking of those funds to move them, through operations on the UTXOs via keys.</p></div>

<h6>Custody</h6>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx10.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx10.p1.1">The topic of ‘custody’ of Bitcoin (addresses,UTXOs) can be confusing at first. This is another area where there’s a lot of detail available, but not all of it is appropriate because increased complexity increases risk. Broadly though it’s important to remember that ownership of a UTXO is passed around using signing keys, which are functions of wallets. Wallets themselves don’t contain Bitcoin, they contain keys. The simplest approach is a software wallet. This is an application on a device, which stores the private keys, and manages signing of transactions which go onto the blockchain. It’s beyond the scope of this book to review or suggest software in detail, but <a href="https://bluewallet.io/" title="">Bluewallet</a> on mobile devices, and <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/" title="">Sparrow Wallet</a> on desktop devices provide rich basic functionality if a reader wishes to get started immediately. Note that these software wallets send your extended public key (the path of those keys) to the wallet providers server, for the monitoring of the blockchain to happen on it’s behalf. They’re updated by the software vendor, not the blockchain direct. To get this to ‘privacy best practice’ commensurate with the aim of this book it’s necessary to run a full node as detailed above, and connect the wallet software to that on a secure or local connection.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx10.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx10.p2.1">So called <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/best-bitcoin-hardware-wallets/" title="">hardware wallets</a> should perhaps be termed signing devices. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/z27jg8/comment/ixfj0w4/?" title="">reddit user</a> simplifies this concept very well: <span id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx10.p2.1.1">“Your hardware wallet is a safe that holds a key. Your bitcoin is in a mailbox that anyone can look at or put more bitcoin into, but nobody can take the bitcoin out unless they have the key stored in your safe. The 24 word seed phrase are the instructions needed to cut a new key.”</span>. Rather than store Bitcoin they store the private key in a more secure way, in a device which interacts with a computer or phone. More recently the hardware and associated software of such devices are building in <a href="https://content.trezor.io/coinjoin" title="">much needed privacy technology</a>. Remember that all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are public. Interestingly these privacy technologies are subject to chain surveillance under the terms of their agreements, and companies like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-fog-roman-sterlingov-blockchain-analysis/" title="">Chainalysis rightly draw criticism</a>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx10.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx10.p3.1">We prefer hardware signing devices which can scan in the seed each time themselves as is the case with opensource <a href="https://seedsigner.com/" title="">“seedsigner”</a>, which also supports Nostr delegation (Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F25" title="Figure 3.25 ‣ Custody ‣ 3.4.3 Technical overview ‣ 3.4 Bitcoin ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>3.25</span></a>). This makes the device perfect for management of all of our proposed metaverse keys.</p></div>

<figcaption><span>Figure 3.25: </span>Seedsigner is an inexpensive open source project which scans the master seed in from a QR code to enable signing. One device can run a quorum based wallet (multisig) and manage Nostr identity.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx10.p4">
<p id="Ch3.S4.SS3.SSSx10.p4.1">For higher security it’s possible to combine hardware and software wallets (signing devices) to provide a quorum of signatures required to move funds. More exotic still are <a href="https://fedimint.org/" title="">proposals like “Fedimint”</a> which allows groups such as families or villages to leverage their personal trust to co-manage Bitcoin. What is not/rarely secure is leaving Bitcoin with a custodian such as an exchange as they simply issue you with an IOU and may abscond. In building toward a proposal for a product in this book it would be simple for us to build a metaverse which users simply paid to use. This is the norm up to now. Representative money would flow around in the metaverse and be changed back like game money at some point. This is not what we wish to promote, so everything will be a variation on “self-custody”, minimising third party trust for users.</p></div>

It brings improved scripting, smart contract capability, privacy, and Schnorr signatures <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx71" title="">71</a>]</cite>, which are a maximally efficient signature verification method. The network will always support older address types. It is rare to get such a large update to the network, and deployment and upgrade was carefully managed over several months under BIP-0008. Uptake will be slow as wallet manufacturers and exchanges add the feature. It can be considered an <a href="https://transactionfee.info/charts/transactions-spending-taproot/" title="">upgrade in progress (0.3%)</a>.

This is also a prerequisite for Drivechains (mentioned later), and improve Spacechains. In a way this can offer other chains the security model of the Bitcoin network, while increasing fees to miners, which might be increasingly important as the block subsidy falls. This is pretty fringe knowledge <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28696#msg28696" title="">originally proposed</a> by Satoshi, but has been refined since and is best explained by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xweFaw69EyA" title="">Paul Sztorc elsewhere</a>.

This would provide higher confidence in the protocol moving forward, as long term investors would be somewhat assured that the parameters of the technology would not change, and potentially pressure on the developers would reduce. There’s a push to get some or all of the features described above in over the next few year before this happens. As ever this is a controversial topic within the development community. Notably Paul Sztorc, inventor of Drivechain <a href="https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/sc-vision/" title="">feels strongly</a> that cessation of innovation is a fundamental mistake, while also agreeing that ossification is necessary.</p></div>

<p id="Ch3.S5.SS3.p1.1">BTCPayServer is one of the recipients of a Spiral grant. It is a self hosted Bitcoin and Lightning payment processor system which allows merchants, online, and physical stores and businesses to integrate Bitcoin into their accounting systems. It might seem that if one were to use Bitcoin then a simple address published on a website might be enough, but this is far from privacy best practice. Using a single address creates a data point which allows external observers to tie all interactions with a given point of sale to all of the customers, and onward to all of their other transactions through the public ledger. Since we seek to employ cyber security best practice will avoid <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse" title="">the issues with address reuse</a>. Each Bitcoin address should be used just once. This is fine as there’s essentially an <a href="https://privacypros.io/btc-faq/how-many-btc-addresses" title="">unlimited number</a> of addresses.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>3.6 </span>Lightning (Layer 2)</h4>
<div id="Ch3.S6.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S6.p1.1">Lightning was a 2016 proposal by Poon and Dryja <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx74" title="">74</a>]</cite>, and is a method for networks of channels of Bitcoin between parties, which can transfer value. The main public network is a community driven liquidity pool which enables scaling and speed improvements for the Bitcoin network. It makes Bitcoin more like money <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx75" title="">75</a>]</cite>. As with Bitcoin base chain there are multiple standards and approaches, but within Lightning these are not necessarily cross compatible with one another, resulting in several Lightning networks. This is to our advantage as innovation is possible within these smaller networks. It is mainly ‘powered’ by <a href="https://plebnet.wiki/wiki/Main_Page" title="">thousands of volunteers</a> who invest in hardware and lock up their Bitcoin in their nodes, to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions. Zebka et al. found that although the network is “fairly decentralised” it is more recently skewing to larger more established nodes <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx76" title="">76</a>]</cite>. Though this is a grassroots technology the nature of the design means it can likely be trusted for small scale commercial applications.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S6.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S6.p2.1">The following text is from <a href="https://medium.com/@johncantrell97?p=5cc72f2c664" title="">John Cantrell</a>, an engineer who works on Lightning.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S6.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S6.p3.1"><span id="Ch3.S6.p3.1.1">“The Lightning Network is a p2p network of payment channels. A payment channel is a contract between two people where they commit funds using a single onchain tx. Once the funds are committed they can make an unlimited amount of instant &amp; free payments over the channel.
You can think of it as a tab where each person tracks how much money they are owed. Each time a payment is made over the channel both parties update their record of how much money each person has. These updates all happen off-chain and only the parties involved know about them. When it‘s time to settle up the two parties can take the final balances of the channel and create a channel closing transaction that will be broadcast on chain. This closing transaction sends each party the final amounts they are owed. This means for the cost of two on-chain transactions (the opening and closing of the channel) two parties can transact an unlimited number of times and the overall cost of each transaction approaches zero with every additional transaction they make over the channel. Payment channels are a great solution for two parties to transact quickly and cheaply but what if we want to be able to send money to anyone in the world quickly and cheaply? This is where the Lightning Network comes into play, it‘s a p2p network of these payment channels. This means if Alice has a payment channel with Bob and Bob has a channel with Charlie that Alice can send a payment to Charlie with Bob‘s help. This idea can be extended such that you can route a payment over an arbitrary number of channels until you can reach the entire world. Routing a payment over multiple channels uses a specific contract called a Hash Time Locked Contract (HTLC). It introduces the ability for Bob and any other nodes you route through to charge a small fee. These fees are typically orders of magnitude smaller than onchain fees. This all sounds great but what if someone tries to cheat? I thought the whole point of Bitcoin was that we no longer had to trust anyone and it sure sounds like there must be some trust in our channel partners to use the Lightning Network? The contracts used in Lightning are built to prevent fraud while requiring no trust. There is a built-in penalty mechanism where if someone tries to cheat and is caught then they lose all of their money. This does mean you need to be monitoring the chain for fraud attempts.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S6.p4">
<p id="Ch3.S6.p4.1">Lightning is a key scaling innovation in the bitcoin network at this time. It is seeing rapid development and adoption (Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F26" title="Figure 3.26 ‣ 3.6 Lightning (Layer 2) ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>3.26</span></a>).

<p id="Ch3.S6.p6.1">The most popular lightning software is <a href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd#readme" title="">LND</a> from Lightning Labs or <a href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning" title="">C-Lightning</a> from Blockstream. The software can be run on top of any Bitcoin full node, in a browser extension with a limited node, in a mobile app as a client or a server, or a hybrid such as the Greenlight server <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/get-ready-for-a-fresh-breez-multiple-apps-one-node-optimal-ux-519c4daf2536" title="">used by Breez wallet</a>.

<span>3.6.2 </span>Micropayments</h5>
<div id="Ch3.S6.SS2.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S6.SS2.p1.1">Possibly the most important affordance of the Lightning network is the concept of micropayments, and streaming micropayments. It is very simple to transfer even <a href="https://satsymbol.com/" title="">one satoshi</a> on Lightning, which is one hundred millionth of a bitcoin, and a small fraction of a penny. This can be a single payment, for a very small goods or service, or a recurring payment on any cadence. This enables streaming payments for any service, or for remittance, or remuneration. These use cases likely have enormous consequences which are just beginning to be explored. Nostr users are seemingly have an enormous amount of fun sending one another tiny amounts of money for free, in response to good posts on the new social media and blog platforms designed around the protocol. This can be seen in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch3.F27" title="Figure 3.27 ‣ 3.6.2 Micropayments ‣ 3.6 Lightning (Layer 2) ‣ Chapter 3 DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>3.27</span></a> and nostr will be described in more detail later.

<section id="Ch3.S6.SS4.SSSx1">
<h6>Cashu</h6>
<div id="Ch3.S6.SS4.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S6.SS4.SSSx1.p1.1">Cashu, an implementation of the e-cash mechanism, is an electronic cash system that allows users to hold and transfer digital representations of money on their devices. In this system, e-cash is a piece of electronic data that represents a certain amount of money, such as satoshis in the case of Bitcoin. Users can send e-cash to others through various encrypted channels like Telegram or email.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S6.SS4.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S6.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1">The concept of e-cash relies on blind signatures, which ensure that transactions cannot be correlated to specific users, providing a high level of privacy. When a user wants to send e-cash, they send the data representing the money to another user. The receiving user then sends the e-cash to a server (or mint) to be recycled. This process ensures that the e-cash cannot be double-spent. However, the server cannot correlate the incoming e-cash to any specific user or transaction.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S6.SS4.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S6.SS4.SSSx1.p3.1">Cashu, as a protocol, enables the implementation of this e-cash mechanism and facilitates interoperability among different Cashu wallets. The system is designed to be private, with no user accounts or wallets associated with any central authority. The e-cash is stored in the user’s browser data, and can be backed up using a seed phrase, similar to traditional cryptocurrency wallets.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S6.SS4.SSSx1.p4">
<p id="Ch3.S6.SS4.SSSx1.p4.1">In its current state, Cashu is in its early stages of development and is primarily intended for experimentation. However, it has the potential to enable a wide range of applications, such as streaming services, where users could pay for content on a per-use basis without the need for an account, and without the service provider being able to track their usage. This would allow for greater privacy and flexibility in how people interact with online services.</p></div>

The excitement in the community is such that this protocol is included in our metaverse stack later.

<p id="Ch3.S6.SS8.p3.1">Ark vs. Lightning: Similar to the Lightning network, Ark is a liquidity network but without liquidity constraints or direct link between sender and receiver. It uses significantly less on-chain footprint as it lacks concepts of opening and closing channels.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S6.SS8.p4">
<p id="Ch3.S6.SS8.p4.1">Ark vs. On-chain: Ark is similar to on-chain wallets in terms of UX, receiving payments asynchronously without introducing liquidity constraints. However, users must "refresh" their coins regularly to avoid service providers sweeping the funds.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S6.SS8.p5">
<p id="Ch3.S6.SS8.p5.1">Ark vs. Validity Rollups: Ark doesn’t require on-chain data per transaction, providing higher throughput. Both need a soft-fork on the base layer, but Ark doesn’t need a soft-fork for the interactive version.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S6.SS8.p6">
<p id="Ch3.S6.SS8.p6.1">Ark service providers can, in theory, double-spend their transactions in mempool. However, it’s counterproductive as recipients can use incoming zero-conf vtxos to pay lightning invoices. If a double-spend occurs, a future Ark extension can allow users to claim their previously redeemed vtxos. This provides an inbound liquidity-like tradeoff without protocol compromise.</p></div>

<span>3.7 </span>Liquid federation (layer 2)</h4>
<div id="Ch3.S7.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S7.p1.1">Liquid is an implementation on Blockstream <a href="https://elementsproject.org/" title="">Elements</a>, and is itself part of the open source development contribution of Blockstream, the company started by Adam Back (of hashcash fame) and nearly a dozen other early cypherpunks and luminaries.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S7.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S7.p2.1">The Liquid side chain network, and it’s own attendant Lightning layer 2, is a fork of Bitcoin with different network parameters. In liquid the user of the network ‘pegs’ into the Bitcoin network, swapping tokens out from BTC to L-BTC (this can of course mean very small subunits of 1 Bitcoin). Once tokens have been ‘locked’ and swapped to Liquid the different network parameters used in the fork allow a different trust/performance trade-off. Liquid is fast on the L1 chain, cheaper to use at this time, and more private. The consensus achieved on this side chain network is faster because it is a far smaller group of node operators. The next block to be written to the side chain is chosen by a node operated by a member of a federation of dozens of major contributors to the Bitcoin technology space. These ‘trusted’ nodes all check one another’s security and network operations, meaning that the network is as secure as the aggregate of the trust placed in half of the membership at any one time. There are
<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-liquid-network-gains-six-new-federation-members" title="">still dozens</a> of major companies, development teams, and individual actors, with significant reputational investment.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S7.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S7.p3.1">“Federation members contribute to the Liquid Network’s security, gain voting rights in the board election and membership process, and provide valuable input on the development of new features. Members also benefit from the ability to perform a peg-out without a third party, allowing their users to convert between L-BTC and BTC seamlessly within their platform.”</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S7.p4">
<p id="Ch3.S7.p4.1">Crucially for our purposes here Liquid allows tokenised asset transfer. Anyone <a href="https://docs.blockstream.com/liquid/developer-guide/developer-guide-index.html#issued-assets" title="">can issue</a> an asset on Liquid. Such transfers of assets may be orders of magnitude cheaper than on chain Bitcoin transactions, but still potentially orders of magnitude more expensive than a simple Lightning transaction of value on the Bitcoin network.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S7.p5">
<p id="Ch3.S7.p5.1">Blockstream plan to add arbitrary (user generated) token support to their ‘Core Lightning’ implementation at some point. This would be a very strong choice for specific use cases within an economically enabled metaverse application. When participants wish to ‘cash out’ of the Liquid network they must do this through one of the federation members who activate the other side of the ‘two-way peg’, dispensing the equivalent amount of Bitcoin. This is transparently handled through Blockstream’s “green wallet”.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S7.p6">
<p id="Ch3.S7.p6.1">All of this has the advantage of a far lower energy footprint compared to the main chain, but it’s not quite ready with a full suite of affordances.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S7.p7">

<span>3.8 </span>Bitcoin Layer 3</h4>
<div id="Ch3.S8.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S8.p1.1">Increasingly important features of modern blockchain implementations are programmability through smart contracts, and issuance of arbitrary tokens. Assigning a transaction to represent another thing like an economic unit, energy unit, or real world object, and operating on those abstractions within the chain logic. Chief among these use cases are stablecoins such as Tether, which are pegged to national currencies and described in the next section. Bitcoin has always supported very limited contracts called scripts, and stablecoin issuance has existed in Bitcoin since
<a href="https://www.omnilayer.org/" title="">Omni Layer</a>. Omni was the first issuer of Tether, but more recently these important features have passed to other layer one chains. This year is likely to see the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-ecosystem-a-guide-to-programming-languages-for-bitcoin-smart-contracts" title="">resurgence of this capability</a> on Bitcoin, which of course benefits from a better security model. Once again, there is a stong assertion by some that <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-April/020227.html" title="">this isn’t even possible</a>. The debate is complex and unresolved.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S8.p2">

<span>3.8.1 </span>LNP/BP and RGB</h5>
<div id="Ch3.S8.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S8.SS1.p1.1"><a href="https://giacomozucco.com/layers-before-bitcoin" title="">LNP/BP</a> is a non profit standards organisation in Switzerland which contributes to open source development of Bitcoin layer 3 solutions into the Lightning protocol, and Bitcoin protocol (LNP/BP). One of the core product developments within their work is the <a href="https://www.rgb.tech/" title="">‘RGB’ protocol</a>, which is somewhat of a meaningless name, evolved from “coloured coins” which were an early tokenised asset system on the Bitcoin network. RGB represents red, green, and blue. The proposal is built upon research by <a href="https://petertodd.org/2016/commitments-and-single-use-seals" title="">Todd</a> and <a href="https://giacomozucco.com/#intro" title="">Zucco</a>. RGB is regarded as arcane Bitcoin technology, even within the already rarefied Bitcoin developer communities. Zucco provides the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/video-interview-giacomo-zucco-rgb-tokens-built-bitcoin" title="">following explanation</a>:</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S8.SS1.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S8.SS1.p2.1"><span id="Ch3.S8.SS1.p2.1.1">“When I want to send you a bitcoin, I will sign the transaction, I will give the transaction only to you, you will be the only one verifying, and then we’ll take a commitment to this transaction and that I will give only the commitment to miners. Miners will basically build a blockchain of commitments, but without the actual validation part. That will be only left to you. And when you want to send the assets to somebody else, you will pass your signature, plus my signature, plus the previous signature, and so on.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S8.SS1.p3">
<p id="Ch3.S8.SS1.p3.1">This is non-intuitive explanation of Todds ‘single-use-seals’, applied to Bitcoin, with the purpose of underpinning arbitrary asset transfer secured by the Bitcoin network. In this model the transacting parties are the exclusive holders of the information about what the object they are transferring actually represents. This primitive can (and has) been expanded by the LNP/BP group into a concept called ‘client side validation’.
It’s appropriate to explain this concept several times from different perspectives, because this is potentially a profoundly useful technology for metaverse applications.</p></div>

In those systems there is a globally available shared consensus of ‘state’. In the LNP/BP technologies the state data is owned, controlled, and stored by the transacting parties. Bitcoin provides the crytographic external proof of a state change in the event of a proof being required. This is an elegant solution in that it takes up virtually no space on the blockchain, is private by design, and is extensible to layer 2 protocols like Lightning.</p></div>

This means it can transparently participate in normal Lightning routing behaviour with other peers.

This can be considered an additional network liquidity problem on top of Lightning, and is the essence of the “Layer 3” moniker associated with LNP/BP. It will require a great number of such nodes to successfully launch token transfer on Lightning.

<p id="Ch3.S8.SS2.p2.1">The project has clearly been <a href="https://github.com/roasbeef/bips/tree/bip-taro" title="">under development</a> by the lead developer at Lightning Labs for some years and seems both <a href="https://lightninglabs.substack.com/p/bitcoinizing-the-dollar-and-the-world?s=r" title="">capable</a> and mature, though they are obviously following the model of ‘co-opting’ open source ideas (from RGB) to garner venture capital funding. They <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1298/commits/4daba8c373c777defb48136795382803c137502c" title="">credit RGB</a> in the github. More will doubtless be added to this section and it seems a contender for our metaverse purposes, being less broadly ambitious than RGB upon which it’s based, but perhaps more focused and implemented. The key feature of Taro seems to be that only the first and last hop in a multi-hop lightning transaction need to support Taro, because of external data validation databases called “universes”. This is an advance on the RGB proposal.
The technical specs are now on the <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/taro" title="">lightning labs web pages</a>, and <a href="https://lightning.engineering/posts/2022-9-28-taro-launch/" title="">code has been released</a>. The beta programme uses testnet.

<div id="Ch3.S9.p2">
<p id="Ch3.S9.p2.1"><span id="Ch3.S9.p2.1.1">“…it is now becoming clear that crypto and DeFi have deeper structural limitations that prevent them from achieving the levels of efficiency, stability or integrity required for an adequate monetary system. In particular, the crypto universe lacks a nominal anchor, which it tries to import, imperfectly, through stablecoins. It is also prone to fragmentation, and its applications cannot scale without compromising security, as shown by their congestion and exorbitant fees. Activity in this parallel system is, instead, sustained by the influx of speculative coin holders. Finally, there are serious concerns about the role of unregulated intermediaries in the system. As they are deep-seated, these structural shortcomings are unlikely to be amenable to technical fixes alone. This is because they reflect the inherent limitations of a decentralised system built on permissionless blockchains.”</span></p></div>

<div id="Ch3.S9.SS2.p1">
<p id="Ch3.S9.SS2.p1.1">For digital assets more generally it is useful to look at the recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/" title="">“whole government executive order”</a> signed by President Biden early in 2022. It was mainly framed in terms of “responsible innovation, and leadership” in the new space. The resulting, “Comprehensive Framework for Responsible Development of Digital Assets” is a product of multi agency collaboration and can be seen as 9 reports and a summary document, and has been long anticipated. The summary itself is neither particularly comprehensive nor a framework, and mainly serves to identifies high level risks, aspirations, and challenges, and strongly hints toward eventual development of a “digital dollar” (CBDC, expanded later).</p></div>

Criminality in 2021 was a mere 0.15% of transactions according to Chainalysis, but this number varies year to year. There are claims that Iran have begun official overseas buying with cryptocurrencies, but again, the <a href="https://finbold.com/iran-makes-the-first-ever-import-of-goods-using-cryptocurrency-worth-millions/" title="">numbers are small</a>. One of the better sections of the work is the US treasury department’s recently published ‘National Risk Assessments for Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing’. This is a comprehensive report and speaks to careful research across the space. It is broken into <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0619" title="">three parts</a>. Perhaps surprisingly, while they do see activity in these areas, they do not rate the risk as very significant. Cash remains the main problem for illicit funding. There is some talk that the nature of public blockchain analysis allows greater oversight of these tools and that this is to the advantage of government and civil enforcement agencies.</p></div>

One thing that seems to shine through is their own perception of their global leadership on legislation on these matters. They seems to assume that what they decide will guide the world, and this may be true through their KYC/AML pressures.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S9.SS2.p4">
<p id="Ch3.S9.SS2.p4.1">A recent proposed <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/heres-whats-in-senator-lummis-bitcoin-bill" title="">bi-partisan bill in the USA</a> will likely help inform global law, though it is unlikely to pass itself. It encourages the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange by applying a tax exemption on transactions of less than $200. The issue of whether an asset is a commodity (a raw material thing) or a security (a promise) is left to a couple of major government agencies to unpick, with corresponding reporting requirements. Crucially for this book these nascent bills all regard both Bitcoin and Ethereum as sufficiently decentralised to <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/a-new-senate-bill-focuses-on-cryptocurrency-exchanges-heres-what-developers-and-users-should-keep-an-eye-on/" title="">qualify as commodities</a>, meaning they would enjoy more lenient oversight. Far more likely to pass is the <a href="https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/crypto_one-pager1.pdf" title="">proposed DCCPA bill</a> which has senior lawmaker support and would see commodities in the space regulated in such a way that trading of it could be halted in the USA. In this line of policy, exchanges will be required to do far more reporting, and would be penalised for trading against their customers. DOAs and DeFi are the big potential losers. In a maddening twist the Office of Government Ethics in the USA has banned anyone who owns digital assets from working on the legislation. This is an exceptional move and likely to result in poorly crafted laws in the first instance.</p></div>
<div id="Ch3.S9.SS2.p5">
<p id="Ch3.S9.SS2.p5.1">The most recent and troubling example is the US ban on any Ethereum assets which have been through a “mixer service” <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/u-s-treasury-sanction-of-privacy-tools-places-sweeping-restrictions-on-all-americans/" title="">that obfuscates history</a>. This is a huge constraint on the code and smart contract itself, not just sanctions against individuals. It has <a href="https://hoffmang9.github.io/free-speech/the-history-code-is-free-speech.html" title="">‘free speech’</a> and constitutional implications <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx80" title="">80</a>]</cite>. More such actions and <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-investigators-say-developer-of-tornado-cash-arrested/a-62793823" title="">arrests of developers</a> are feared. It has led to Circle (who issue the USDC stablecoin) blacklisting every <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20220808" title="">address sanctioned by the US government</a>. Centrally issued digital assets are obviously neither uncensorable nor permissionless. This intersects (again) with the whole question of what decentralisation means and how effective it can be in it’s stated goal of circumventing global policies.</p></div>

<h3>
<span>Chapter 4 </span>Money in the real world</h3>
<div id="Ch4.p1">
<p id="Ch4.p1.1">It is necessary here to briefly examine what money actually is in the world outside of metaverses, so we can understand it in the context of a virtual global space. In the previous section Bitcoin can be viewed in a couple of different lights. As a self custody digital bearer asset it can be viewed as ‘property’, like gold, i.e. not a liability on someone else’s asset sheet. Indeed this has long been one of the assertions of the community and it finds favour in law, <a href="https://www.regulationasia.com/shanghai-court-says-bitcoin-is-protected-by-law-as-virtual-property/" title="">possible most ironically in China</a> which of course banned mining. ‘Money’ though is a far more <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/what-is-money" title="">slippery concept</a> to grasp. It seems very likely that Bitcoin is evolving as a “base money”, and it’s important to define that, but there are many other kinds of money within the online world which can potentially transfer value within virtual social spaces.</p></div>
<section id="Ch4.S1">
<h4>
<span>4.1 </span>Defining money</h4>
<div id="Ch4.S1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S1.p1.1">Money is an economic good, that is generally accepted as a medium of exchange. This simple and specific description doesn’t do justice to the complexity of everything that humans consider to be money. Even the Encyclopaedia Britannica strays from this immediately in their definition:</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S1.p2.1"><span id="Ch4.S1.p2.1.1">“money, a commodity accepted by general consent as a medium of economic exchange. It is the medium in which prices and values are expressed; as currency, it circulates anonymously from person to person and country to country, thus facilitating trade, and it is the principal measure of wealth.”</span>. 
<br>In which it can be seen that the principle measure of wealth might not be money at all, but rather property, credit, etc. So are these things money? Is a promise on a ledger money? The assertion at the top of this section is challenged by different schools of economic thinking. Global debt is around an order of magnitude larger than base money, and most wealth is stored in illiquid land/built environment (some $300T), and yet the system seems to work fine. The debt theory of money offered by anthropologist David Graeber suggests that money is an abstraction of barter, and thereby ‘credit’, but credit clearly pre-dates money, and needs no barter, commodity, intermediary nor underlying asset <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx88" title="">88</a>]</cite>. This suggests that money is something slightly different.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S1.p3.1">Money seems to have evolved for two principle purposes; trade outside of a village context, and inheritance <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx89" title="">89</a>]</cite>. In doing this it somewhat replaced and augmenting ‘credit’, which as said above, was a promise between parties based on future actions, and likely as old as rudimentary language itself. The anonymous Heavyside blog <a href="https://heaviside.substack.com/p/the-forgotten-fourth-function-of" title="">powerfully argues</a> that it is the relative stability of money over time which creates a less discussed composite feature; that of ‘confidence’ in being able to defer labour into money, basically credit again.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S1.p4.1">Money can be divided into two categories, which are fungible (interchangeable) from the point of view of the users. Base money is ‘commodity’ money which is backed by assets, or tangible physical (or digital) goods through the actions of a central bank ledger, and is around $30-$40T. Everything else is ‘fiduciary media’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx90" title="">90</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S1.p5.1">All fiduciary money is credit but not all credit is fiduciary money. Nobody knows the extent of the global supply of fiduciary media. It encapsulates all the new digital money platforms like PayPal, gift cards, offshore accounts and all manner of other vehicles, and is thought to be many <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2212h.pdf" title="">tens of trillions of pounds</a><cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx91" title="">91</a>]</cite>. This somewhat muddies the waters since money that is backed by ‘something’ blends away into money which cannot reasonably be assayed. This in turn undermines the assertion that money is backed. It seems that a combination of available raw materials and labour, central banks and their associated political structures <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx92" title="">92</a>]</cite>, and global markets drive the value of money up and down relative to “stuff” in the shops. This manifests as ‘inflation’, which is ‘possibly’ the effect of not pegging money to an asset such as silver, or gold as in the past <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx93" title="">93</a>]</cite>. While the gross drivers of inflation seems to be accepted and understood, nobody <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10966165/Jerome-Powell-admits-understand-better-little-understand-inflation.html" title="">seems very sure</a> how the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-08-19/this-economy-is-proving-too-complicated-for-economists" title="">various aspects interact</a>. Dickson White wrote in 1914 about hyperinflation in France due to excessive money printing, and this driver and causal link persists as a primary hypothesis for inflation and hyperinflation, a cautionary tale especially today after the huge fiscal responses to the 2008 global financial crisis and COVID <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx94" title="">94</a>]</cite>. It may be that central banks actually have no decent response to global monetary pressures and are overdue a paradigm shift, as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2d79d153-fffa-4441-b79f-0a808a51108f" title="">explained by Daniela Gabor</a> (Professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol):
<br><span id="Ch4.S1.p5.1.1">“…last stage of a central banking paradigm, when it implodes under the contradictions of its class politics? Under the financial capitalism supercycle of the past decades, inflation-targeting central banks have been outposts of (financial) capital in the state, guardians of a distributional status-quo that destroyed workers’ collective power while building safety nets for shadow banking.
<br>The limits of this institutional arrangement that concentrates (pricing) power and profit in (a few) corporate hands are now plain to see. If the climate and geopolitical of 2022 are omens of Isabel Schnabel’s Great Volatility that most central banks and pundits expect for the near future, then macro-financial stability requires new framework for co-ordination between central banks and Treasuries that can support a state more willing to, and capable of, disciplining capital.
<br>But such a framework would threaten the privileged position that central banks have had in the macro-financial architecture and in our macroeconomic models. The history of central banking teaches us that policy paradigms die when they cannot offer a useful framework for stabilising macroeconomic conditions, but never at the hands of central bankers themselves.”</span></p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S1.SS1.p1.2">She argues that as societies advanced, precious metals like gold and silver became the dominant monies.

<div id="Ch4.S1.SS1.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS1.p2.1">To enhance the use of precious metals as money, layers were added on top. The creation of coinage allowed the weight and purity of raw metals to be verified. Coins also blended the intrinsic value of metals with the authority of the institutions issuing them. Legal tender laws mandated the acceptance of certain coinages for debt repayment.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS1.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS1.p3.1">The emergence of paper money and banking provided another layer of enhancement. Paper banknotes initially facilitated long distance trade by avoiding the need to physically move heavy metals.

Banknotes increased transferability and divisibility of money without moving the underlying metals.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS1.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS1.p4.1">Debates arose between the credit and commodity theories of money. The credit theory views money as a shared ledger, with value derived from the authority of the issuer. In contrast, the commodity theory sees money emerge naturally due to the properties of the underlying commodity. Disagreements still center on the role of the state and whether money requires intrinsic value.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS1.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS1.p5.1">Alden thinks that over time, flaws became apparent in state controlled monetary regimes. The ability to non-transparently tax through inflation and currency debasement led to the degradation of monetary systems. Most state currencies have experienced high inflation or hyperinflation. They survive due to lack of alternatives rather than soundness. Commodity-based monies constrained state overreach and lasted longer before breaking down.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>4.1.2 </span>Understanding money creation</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS2.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS2.p1.1">There are two main types of money in our current system: financial money and real economy money.
Financial money refers to bank reserves, which are created by central banks through quantitative easing (QE). The central bank buys bonds from banks and credits their reserve accounts with new digital bank reserves.
Bank reserves are an asset for commercial banks. Reserves allow banks to settle transactions with each other and meet liquidity requirements set by regulators.
Importantly, bank reserves do not directly translate into increased lending or stimulus for the real economy. There is no direct channel for reserves to enter the broader economy. The amount of reserves does not drive bank lending.
Real economy money refers to money that households and businesses can use for transactions. This includes physical currency and bank deposits.
Real economy money is created through government deficits and private sector credit expansion.</p></div>
<section id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx1">
<h6>Government deficits drive money creation and inflation</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx1.p1.1">When the government spends more than it taxes, it is creating net new financial assets in the economy. Government deficits add net financial wealth to the private sector.
This increases private sector deposits and spending capacity. When people then spend this new money, it stimulates aggregate demand and economic activity.
Several empirical examples demonstrate how increasing government deficits leads to higher GDP growth and inflation by injecting more money into the real economy.
Conversely, austerity policies that reduce deficits, like higher taxes or less spending, destroy private sector financial assets and reduce economic activity.
Therefore, government deficits and surpluses have a much more direct impact on the real economy compared to central bank operations that alter the supply of bank reserves.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx1.p2.1">In their paper for the 2023 central bank meeting at Jackson Hole Eichengreen and Arslanalp <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx98" title="">98</a>]</cite> argue that the 2008 global financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic have caused public debt levels to balloon to unprecedented heights across advanced, emerging, and developing economies, and that contrary to the calls of major financial institutions, high public debts are unlikely to meaningfully decline in the foreseeable future.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx1.p3.1">They say this is because the conventional options for debt reduction like running large primary budget surpluses, relying on higher growth rates, or using inflation to erode real debt burdens are politically and economically infeasible today (though AI perhaps offers a slim productivity ‘out’). At the same time, changes in the global financial system like the rise of private creditors have made coordinated debt restructuring more challenging. As a result, the world will have to learn to live with persistently high public debts. This may be manageable for major advanced countries like the US that benefit from structural demand for their safe assets. But it poses greater risks for emerging and developing economies that lack this advantage. Creative solutions like GDP-indexed bonds, credit enhancements, and legal reforms are needed to facilitate sustainable debt restructuring for weaker countries weighed down by debt overhangs. Overall, the shift from bank to bond financing and the changing composition of creditors have reduced options for unwinding high public debts accumulated due to recent crises. It’s a mess.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx2">
<h6>Private credit drives money creation and asset inflation</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx2.p1.1">Private credit creation through bank lending also increases the money supply by allowing households and businesses to purchase assets they couldn’t otherwise afford.
When banks create new loans, they are simultaneously creating new purchasing power in the form of deposits for the borrower, allowing asset purchases with new credit.
This increases broader money supply and spending capacity, but also creates an offsetting debt liability owed back to the bank.
Rapid private credit growth risks fueling asset bubbles and financial instability if debts can’t be repaid. This primarily benefits those who already own assets.
Private credit growth is more disciplined by market forces compared to unchecked government deficits, but still risks inflating asset prices.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx3">
<h6>The risks of the current system and alternatives</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx3.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS2.SSSx3.p1.1">The current elastic credit money system aims to prevent recessions by constantly expanding credit. However, this artificial stability leads to financial instability long-term.
Alternatives like Bitcoin have a firm supply anchor and cannot rapidly expand the money supply. This prevents runaway credit growth and provides monetary discipline.
However, Bitcoin and hard money standards also provide less flexibility to respond to economic crises by expanding credit. There are tradeoffs between flexibility and discipline.
Our current monetary system relies heavily on expanding real economy purchasing power through government deficits and private credit in order to drive economic growth. However, this constant elasticity promotes financial instability and inequality over the long-run, mainly because of shorter term political incentives. We will see that potential alternatives like Bitcoin offer more stability through monetary discipline, but sacrifice flexibility. It’s likely that trading off a known flawed system for an unknown replacement is far too risky, but with sufficient adoption there may be a ‘flight to safety’. Bitcoin represents a serious risk if it compounds the worst elements and outcomes of a mishandled cyclical credit based system.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p1.1">The legacy moniker “third world” came from a division of the world along economic lines <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx99" title="">99</a>]</cite>.

<p id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p3.1">Right now the dollar system is still predominant, but it seems likely that there are new axes forming, especially around the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-considers-accepting-yuan-instead-of-dollars-for-chinese-oil-sales-11647351541" title="">Chinese Yuan</a>.

The Dollar has potentially suffered from the radical expansion of the money supply over the last 70 years or so under the private “Eurodollar” system <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx102" title="">102</a>]</cite>. Macro markets commentator Peccatiello <a href="https://themacrocompass.substack.com/p/usd-hidden-debt#details" title="">describes this</a> as follows: <span id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p3.1.1">“Our monetary and credit system is USD-centric: the lion share of international debt, trade invoices, asset classes and FX volume is settled or denominated in US Dollars. Funnily enough though, direct access to $ liquidity is only available to entities located in the United States but in a credit-based system the rest of the world also has an incentive to leverage in US Dollars to boost or enhance their global business models. That means European banks, Brazilian corporates or Japanese insurance companies which want to do global business will most likely get exposure to $-denominated assets and liabilities ($ debt) despite being domiciled outside the United States.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p4.1">Some policy makers have been looking back to the great economist John Maynard Keynes’ ideas for a neutral basket of assets as a global synthetic hedgemonic currency <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx103" title="">103</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx104" title="">104</a>]</cite> which would almost certainly consist partly of gold <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx105" title="">105</a>]</cite>. Gold as a utilitarian commodity trades at a premium because of it’s history as a money, and like Bitcoin, there are <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/02/27/the-dystopian-underworld-of-south-africas-illegal-gold-mines" title="">serious consequences</a> to it’s perceived value to humans.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p5.1">Use of the dollar system has recently been shown more and more to be contingent on adherence to US defined political principles. This is evidenced most starkly by the seizure of Russian central bank <a href="https://twitter.com/RussianEmbassy/status/1504530573527760909" title="">foreign reserves</a>, a new and untried projection of monetary power. Counter intuitively this allowed Russia to demand sale of it’s natural resources in their native Ruble, rapidly increasing the buying power of their currency. It seems that the <a href="https://mronline.org/2022/04/16/russias-sergey-glazyev-introduces-the-new-global-financial-system/" title="">‘currency wars’</a> are accelerating. Putin (who to be clear, is a dictator and aggressor) <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-calls-payment-system-based-135512758.html" title="">recently said</a> <span id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p5.1.1">“The technology of digital currencies and blockchains can be used to create a new system of international settlements that will be much more convenient, absolutely safe for its users and, most importantly, will not depend on banks or interference by third countries”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p6">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p6.1">The Chinese Yuan/Renminbi is potentially stepping in where the petrodollar is now waning <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx106" title="">106</a>]</cite>. The effects of this expansion of economic influence by China, through a potential petro-Yuan, and the belt and road initiative <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx107" title="">107</a>]</cite>, are not yet felt, but the lines are fairly clearly defined and may be felt over the coming decades. The Euro system is potentially even less stable because of recent energy supply pressures, and <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/energy-crisis-increases-fiscal-risks-to-western-europe-sovereigns-23-09-2022" title="">internal tensions</a> in the bond markets. Though it seems to be less ‘weaponised’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx108" title="">108</a>]</cite>, it comes with it’s own restrictions for use, especially through the International Monetary Fund (IMF). They are opposed to global fragmentation and multi-polarity, seeing is as disproportionately impacting emerging economies. They say in ther <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2023/04/11/world-economic-outlook-april-2023?cid=bl-com-spring2023flagships-WEOEA2023001" title="">2023 outlook report</a> that the rise of geoeconomic fragmentation could cause shifts in foreign direct investment (FDI), hitting emerging economies the hardest. They feel that policymakers and companies are focusing on making supply chains more resilient by moving production closer to home or to trusted countries. As a result, FDI flows are becoming more concentrated within blocs of aligned countries. It is likely true that emerging market and developing economies are more vulnerable to FDI relocation, as they rely more on flows from geopolitically distant countries, though this could be viewed as a reduction in economic imperialism. Such economies may face reduced access to capital and technological advancements. It is into this gap that our work presenting AI collaborative tooling wishes to step.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p7">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p7.1">To give context to this it is useful to paraphrase Whittemore’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOqQSKbfRu4" title="">podcast</a> which gave a high level view of Gladsteins <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/imf-world-bank-repress-poor-countries" title="">critique of the IMF</a>: <span id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p7.1.1">“The terms of the most recent IMF loans to Argentina; one that was just finalized this year was that the country’s leadership had to try, as part of their agreement, to discourage citizens from engaging in the use of cryptocurrencies. The most recent deal was a 45 billion dollar deal which is a restructuring of that 57 billion program that Alex mentioned. The provision in question was called ‘strengthening Financial resilience’, and says ‘to further Safeguard Financial stability we are taking important to discourage the use of cryptocurrencies with a view to preventing money laundering informality and disintermediation’. They explicitly do not want citizens of that country to disintermediate. They want them to have to go through the system that the IMF is “restructuring”, meanwhile inflation this
year is around 72 percent. Last year it was 48 the year before 42 the year before that 53 percent clearly something is not working. It’s not surprising to me then that Argentina is an absolute hotbed for people who are involved in
Bitcoin”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p8">
<p id="Ch4.S1.SS3.p8.1">The new ‘third world’ who are excluded from the Dollar and/or Yuan poles of the global economy might drift toward the ‘basket of assets’ discussed by Keynes and Carney above. As mentioned this will certainly have a component of gold, and likely other commodity assets such as rare metals. This is described at length by Hudson<cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx108" title="">108</a>]</cite>. For our purposes here it’s also possible that there would be a small ‘hedge’ allocation of Bitcoin or <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/bitcoin-el-salvador-crypto-btc-b2079881.html" title="">even a global axis</a> of ‘unaligned’ nations using the asset <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx109" title="">109</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx110" title="">110</a>]</cite>. Block and Wakefield research <a href="https://block.xyz/2022/btc-report.pdf" title="">found that in developed nations</a> Bitcoin is treated as in investment, while in less wealthy demographics there is interest in the utility. This is evidenced in the early nation state adoption seen and described to date, and the game theory incentive explained by Fidelity in the introduction. It’s too early to tell if this ‘unaligned money’ could constitute a global economic pole, but it’s interesting that some commentators are now even discussing this, and that <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ynl5bbdTqev-wbTAWQoeWdh1cJVf3ortuSjre9K9wGQ/edit" title="">carbon neutrality research</a> is being undertaken specifically for this application.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S2.p1.1">Transferring money from one financial jurisdiction to another is itself a global marketplace which has accreted over the entire course of human history. It’s far less useful here to discuss the mythos of salt and seashells as a mechanisms of international remittance and taxation <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx111" title="">111</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx112" title="">112</a>]</cite>. Suffice it to say that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of cross border payment companies who make their business from taking a percentage cut of an international money transfer. There are also hundreds if not thousands of banks who offer this service as part of their core business portfolio. This section looks at some of the major players, and their mechanism, to contextualise the more recent shifts brought about by technology.</p></div>
<section id="Ch4.S2.SS1">
<h5>
<span>4.2.1 </span>Swift, ISO 20022, and correspondence banking</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S2.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S2.SS1.p1.1">Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Communiactions (SWIFT) was initially formed in 1973 between 239 banks across 15 countries. They needed a way to improve handling of cross border payments. It is now the global <a href="https://www.swift.com/standards" title="">standard</a> for financial message exchange in over 200 countries, and has recently found itself under a fresh spotlight, during the invasion of Ukraine. The system handles around 40 million short, secure, code transmissions a day, which represent crucial data about a transaction and the parties involved. It is used by both banks and major financial institutions to speed up settlement between themselves, on behalf of the clients and customers. It replaced the Telex (wire transfer) system. The new incoming standard to replace SWIFT is <a href="https://www.swift.com/standards/iso-20022" title="">ISO20022</a> is a complex and data rich arrangement. The SWIFT consortium are promoting this new standard to their 11,000 plus global user base. A group of ‘crytocurrencies’ are heavily involved in the ISO20022 standard, and there’s been experimentation with private permissioned distributed ledger technologies. It’s somewhat unclear what value they bring, and possible that the relationship of these public ledgers to international bank to bank messaging is a marketing distraction. The Bank Of England is <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/rtgs-renewal-programme/consultation-on-a-new-messaging-standard-for-uk-payments-iso20022" title="">transitioning to the system</a> in June 2023. Note that SWIFT, ISO20022, and the associated tokens within crypto are all themselves products which have a business model. They are all intermediaries which will demand a mediating fee somewhere. All of this proposed functionality could be replaced by central bank digital currencies, which will be discussed later in the section.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S2.SS6.p3.1">This comparison makes it pretty clear that Bitcoin is not ready as a personal mobile payment system. That’s not to say that there isn’t a place for the underlying technology in global payment processing.
The most interesting example of this is Strike, a product in the international fintech arena. It is a ‘global’ money transmitter which uses bank connections in local currencies, but a private version of the Lightning network with settlement on the Bitcoin main chain. In practice users connect the app to their bank and can send money to the bank connected Strike app of another user instantly, and without a fee. This is a far better product than those previously available. In principle it’s open API allows many more applications to be integrated into the Strike back end. Twitter already uses this for international tipping (and remittance). It seems that this is a perfect contender for supporting transactions in open metaverse applications, and that may be true, but Strike is currently only available in three countries (USA, El Salvador, Argentina).</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S2.SS6.p5.1">Apple has recently introduced a high-yield Savings account with an impressive 4.15 % APY, far surpassing the national average of 0.35 % APY. This development represents another milestone for the tech giant as it progresses towards potentially becoming the world’s largest bank. The Apple Savings account, established through a collaboration with Goldman Sachs, offers numerous benefits, including an interest rate more than ten times the national average, zero fees, no minimum deposit or balance requirements, and an efficient, user-friendly interface. Additionally, it provides FDIC insurance for balances up to $250,000. Although the 4.15 % APY is lower than returns from money market funds and 1 % below the 3-Month Treasury Bill Yield of 5.2 %, most people may not be aware of these alternatives. The key factors driving demand for Apple’s offering are convenience and the strong brand trust it enjoys.
With products such as Apple Pay, Apple Cash, mPOS, Apple Card, Apple Pay Later, and now Apple Savings, the company is strategically constructing an Apple Finance empire poised to disrupt the traditional financial services landscape.</p></div>

<div id="Ch4.S2.SS7.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S2.SS7.p1.1">Stablecoins are ‘crypto like’ instruments which are ‘pegged’ at a 1:1 ratio with nationally issued Fiat currencies. In fact they usually correspond to units of privately issued debt underwritten by a variety of different assets. This is (depending on the issuing company’s model) a <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/ststablecoins-are-backed-by-reserves-give-us-a-break" title="">far more risky</a> unit of money than the nominal currency that they represent, but they offer significant utility. They allow the user to self custody the cryptographic bearer instrument representing the money themselves, as with blockchain. This may afford the user less friction in that they can transmit the instrument through the newer financial rails which are emerging. Once again, this is likely a product most useful to <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/the-future-of-fintech-is-unfolding-in-africa/?" title="">emerging markets</a>, those living under oppressive regimes, currencies <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-03/argentines-seek-hedging-in-crypto-after-economy-minister-resigns" title="">suffering from high inflation</a>, and countries who rely on the dollar as their currency, and within digitally native metaverse applications. These are <span id="Ch4.S2.SS7.p1.1.1">enormous</span> global uses though. The use in the west is prominently for ‘traders’ on exchanges at this time. /par

It’s important to know that these tokenised dollars and/or other currencies are issued on top of the public blockchains we have been detailing throughout. Which tokens are on what blockchains is constantly evolving, so it’s not really worth enumerating specifics. In a metaverse application it would be necessary to manage both the underlying public blockchain and the stablecoin issued on top of it, making the interaction with the global financial system perversely more not less complex.

It’s has a better transparency record than tether but is still not backed 1:1 by actual dollars in reserve. It may or may not be a fractional reserve asset. It’s well positioned to take advantage of regulatory changes in the USA, and seems to be quietly lobbying to be the choice of a government endorsed digital dollar, at least a significant part of a central bank digital currency initiative. It’s too early to tell how this will work out, but it has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/04/13/blackrocks-newest-investment-paves-the-way-for-digital-assets-on-wall-street/?" title="">substantial ‘legacy finance backing’</a>. It is the only stablecoin to increase slightly in value (depegging upward) in the wake of the UST implosion. This ‘flight to quality’ shows the advantage of the work that CENTRE put into regulatory compliance. It runs on Ethereum, Algorand, Solana, Stellar, Tron, Hedera, Avalanche and Flow blockchains. At this time USDC may be <a href="https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/1567472488589963264" title="">under speculative attack</a> by Chinese exchange Binance, in favour of their own offering BUSD, and is losing market share.</p></div>

These dai can then be used across the Ethereum network. Despite the problems with DAOs, and the problems with Ethereum, DAI is well liked by its community of users and has a healthy billion dollars of issuance.

It worked in concert with the LUNA token on the Cosmos blockchain in order to keep it’s dollar stability. It was not backed in the same way as the other tokens, instead relying on an arbitrage mechanism using LUNA. In essence the protocol paid users to destroy LUNA and mint UST when the price was above one dollar, and vice versa. This theoretically maintained the dollar peg. There was much concern that this model of <a href="https://mirror.xyz/damsondao.eth/OVeBrmrfcWm7uKLlA2Q4W1XTVkFU3cMKfNWhgf7mQuM" title="">‘algorithmic stable coin’</a> is unstable <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx113" title="">113</a>]</cite>.

This failed to address the ‘great depegging’, with LUNA crashing to essentially zero, destroying some $50B of capital. It will now likely act as a cautionary tale to other institutions considering Bitcoin as a ‘reserve asset’.

This has been a meteoric rise, attracting the ire and scrutiny of <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21" title="">regulators</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether" title="">investigators</a>. There was considerable doubt that Tether had sufficient assets backing their synthetic dollars, but the market seems not to mind. Recently however they have transitioned to being backed by US treasury bills, a perfect asset for this use case. It’s resilience against ‘bank runs’ was tested in May 2022 when $9B was redeemed directly for dollars in a few days following the UST crash (more on this later). They are <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-to-launch-gbpt-tether-tokens-pegged-to-the-british-pound-sterling/" title="">shortly to launch</a> a GBP version for the UK. It’s an important technology for this metaverse conversation because of intersections with Bitcoin through the Lightning network. Tether might actually provide everything needed. It’s only as safe as the trust invested in the central issuer though, and the leadership and history of the company <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tether-ownership-and-company-weaknesses-revealed-in-documents-11675363340" title="">are questionable</a>. It’s notable and somewhat ironic that it’s perhaps better and more transparently backed than most banks, and probably all novel fiat fintech products. We can employ the asset through the Taro technology described earlier but we would rather use something with higher regulatory assurances.</p></div>

Last summer we fought a provision in the infrastructure bill that damaged the privacy of crypto users by expanding the broker definition (who needs to report information about transactions to the IRS) &amp; crypto 6050I reporting (reports on business transactions over $10,000). The winter before we fought and successfully delayed a rushed proposal from the outgoing Trump administration to mandate that exchanges collect information about persons who are not their customers, who hold crypto at addresses in wallets they control directly. the Stablecoin TRUST Act would stop these encroachments, constrain the treasury from collecting any nonpublic information unless they get a search warrant or collect only information voluntarily provided to an exchange by a customer and for a legitimate business purpose. If “voluntarily provided for a legitimate business purpose” sounds familiar to you, that’s b/c it’s the constitutional standard articulated by the Court in Carpenter describing LIMITED circumstances where warrantless searches of customer data are ok.It’s the standard we’ve advocated must also limit warrantless data collection at crypto exchanges.

The bank operates globally, with a strong presence in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as a growing presence in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions.

In addition there is code in the contracts allowing them (or any party with access) to remotely <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xf7790914dc335b20aa19d7c9c9171e14e278a134#code" title="">‘burn’ or revoke the money</a> from a wallet.

USDC is furthest along this possible adoption curve. Their partnership with global payment provider Stripe has <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/expanding-global-payouts-with-crypto" title="">enabled global dollar transfer</a> within Twitter for users of their ‘Connect’ platform. This leverages the Polygon chain (mentioned in the blockchain chapter). Many digital wallets can be connected from the user end, with Metamask potentially being the easiest to integrate. This has also been mentioned in the book. The downside of this for our open platform is that none of these elements are particularly open, or distributed, and the users of the platform will still need to use an exchange to get the USDC to spend. This approach makes it easier for the vendors and product providers in the metaverse applications to accept USDC, but everything else is actually harder.</p></div>

<br><span id="Ch4.S3.p6.1.1">“Sec. 4. Policy and Actions Related to United States Central Bank Digital Currencies. (a) The policy of my Administration on a United States CBDC is as follows:
<br>(i) Sovereign money is at the core of a well-functioning financial system, macroeconomic stabilization policies, and economic growth. My Administration places the highest urgency on research and development efforts into the potential design and deployment options of a United States CBDC. These efforts should include assessments of possible benefits and risks for consumers, investors, and businesses; financial stability and systemic risk; payment systems; national security; the ability to exercise human rights; financial inclusion and equity; and the actions required to launch a United States CBDC if doing so is deemed to be in the national interest.
<br>(ii) My Administration sees merit in showcasing United States leadership and participation in international fora related to CBDCs and in multi<span id="Ch4.S3.p6.1.1.1">-</span>country conversations and pilot projects involving CBDCs. Any future dollar payment system should be designed in a way that is consistent with United States priorities (as outlined in section 4(a)(i) of this order) and democratic values, including privacy protections, and that ensures the global financial system has appropriate transparency, connectivity, and platform and architecture interoperability or transferability, as appropriate.
<br>(iii) A United States CBDC may have the potential to support efficient and low-cost transactions, particularly for cross<span id="Ch4.S3.p6.1.1.2">-</span>border funds transfers and payments, and to foster greater access to the financial system, with fewer of the risks posed by private sector-administered digital assets. A United States CBDC that is interoperable with CBDCs issued by other monetary authorities could facilitate faster and lower-cost cross-border payments and potentially boost economic growth, support the continued centrality of the United States within the international financial system, and help to protect the unique role that the dollar plays in global finance. There are also, however, potential risks and downsides to consider. We should prioritize timely assessments of potential benefits and risks under various designs to ensure that the United States remains a leader in the international financial system.”</span></p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S3.p7.1">In traditional nation state currencies the central banks <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/bank-of-england-market-operations-guide" title="">control the amount</a> of currency in circulation by issuing debt to private banks, which is then loaned out to individuals <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx115" title="">115</a>]</cite>. The debt is ‘destroyed’ on the balance sheet to remove currency through the reverse mechanism. They also facilitate government debt <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx116" title="">116</a>]</cite>, and work (theoretically) outside of political control to adjust interest rates, in order to manage growth and flows of money.</p></div>

A US central bank digital currency is being examined to help the US dollar’s international standing.”</span>. This is a rapid evolution of the narrative, with implications. It seems unlikely that the world would sacrifice the traditional banking system in favour of centrally controlled money, but many things which cannot be done with traditional nation state money systems are possible with CBDCs, because they <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/benefits-central-bank-digital-currency" title="">remove the middleman</a> of private banking between the end user and the policy makers.</p><ul id="Ch4.S3.I1">

Eswar Prasad says “In authoritarian societies, central bank money in digital form could become an additional instrument of government control over citizens rather than just a convenient, safe, and stable medium of exchange<cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx119" title="">119</a>]</cite>.” This is possibly <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1581378124452753408" title="">already happening</a> in China through integration of outstanding debt data with the social credit system.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S3.p9.1">The UK had been signalled that it is not interested in developing a CBDC stating that it seemed to be a <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/8443/documents/85604/default/" title="">solution in search of a problem</a>, with the Lords economic affairs committee saying:<span id="Ch4.S3.p9.1.1">“The introduction of a UK CBDC would have far-reaching consequences for households, businesses, and the monetary system for decades to come and may pose significant risks depending on how it is designed. These risks include state surveillance of people’s spending choices, financial instability as people convert bank deposits to CBDC during periods of economic stress, an increase in central bank power without sufficient scrutiny, and the creation of a centralised point of failure that would be a target for hostile nation state or criminal actors.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S3.p10">
<p id="Ch4.S3.p10.1">Since those initial statements however it seems that the previously mentioned “fear of missing out” has forced legislators hand. The UK Treasury and the Bank of England are now exploring the possibility of launching a retail central bank digital currency (which they desperately hope will not end up called ‘Britcoin’), judging that “it is likely a digital pound will be needed in the future”. They have released a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hm-treasury-and-bank-of-england-consider-plans-for-a-digital-pound" title="">consultation paper</a> inviting public comment. The consultation is aimed at informing the decision on whether to build the infrastructure for a digital pound, with a pilot test not expected before 2025.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S3.p11">
<p id="Ch4.S3.p11.1">One of the key points raised in the proposal is the potential to cap citizens’ CBDC holdings, with a range suggested between £10,000 to £20,000, to strike a balance between managing risks and supporting the usability of the digital pound. This limit would allow most UK wage earners to receive their salary in the form of a CBDC but would still allow for competition with commercial banks. The digital pound would not offer interest, enabling banks to offer competitive deposit accounts.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S3.p12">
<p id="Ch4.S3.p12.1">They are once again clear about the risks, highlighting that banks currently use deposits as a cheap source of funding for loans, and without that flow, they may become more reliant on expensive wholesale markets, driving up borrowing costs for users. In a severe scenario, a bank run could undermine the capital base for the commercial banking system.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S3.p13">
<p id="Ch4.S3.p13.1">The Bank of England has stated that it will not implement central bank initiated programmable functions, but instead provide the necessary infrastructure for the private sector to implement such features with user consent. The digital pound is intended to have at least the same level of privacy as a bank account and users would be able to make choices about data use. This is scant comfort, as such features are intrinsic to the technology, and we have seen time and again that if legislative and economic bodies are given a hammer, they will eventually find a nail to hit. Carlo, the director of ‘The Big Brother watch’ <a href="https://twitter.com/silkiecarlo/status/1622912736102346752" title="">pointed to</a> 2021 comments from John cunliff of the bank of England when he said “There’s a whole range of things that programmable money could do like giving the children pocket money but programming the money so it couldn’t be used for sweets”. Again, this raises the potential for government stimulus that has to be spent within a certain time or it disappears. As an interesting side note here it’s thought that up to 14% of American stimulus cheques went to buying crypto, most notably in less well off families <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx120" title="">120</a>]</cite>. It’s easy to imagine that a CBDC would be barred from such a thing.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S3.p14">
<p id="Ch4.S3.p14.1">The main motivation for issuing a CBDC is the assumption that there is demand for a safe and stable way to use money online. A digital pound, issued and backed by the Bank of England, could be a trusted, accessible, and easy-to-use form of payment. The infrastructure would allow firms to design innovative and user-friendly services. The civil service is hiring a “Head of CBDC” as seen in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch4.F4" title="Figure 4.4 ‣ 4.3 Central bank digital currencies ‣ Chapter 4 Money in the real world ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>4.4</span></a>.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S3.p15.1">Meanwhile in Europe, ECB President <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2022/html/ecb.is220310~1bc8c1b1ca.en.html#qa" title="">Christine Legarde</a> said: <span id="Ch4.S3.p15.1.1">“On your question concerning CBDC, you know my views on CBDC and you know that I have pushed that project. Fabio Panetta is working hard on that together with members in the entire Eurosystem with the high-level taskforce that is working really hard on moving forward. But in a way, I am really pleased that attention is now focussed on the role that cryptos can play and the role that Central Bank Digital Currency can have when they are implemented. We have a schedule, as you know. The Governing Council decided back in October ’21 to launch a two-year investigation phase, and it is at the end of that investigation phase that the decision will definitely be made to launch the CBDCs and to make it a reality. We can’t go wrong with that project. I am confident that we will move ahead, but that’s going to be a decision of the Governing Council. I think it’s an imperative to respond to what the Europeans expect, and I think we have to be a little bit ahead of the curve if we can on that front. If we can accelerate the work, I hope we can accelerate the work. I will certainly support that and I was delighted to see that in the United States there was an executive order by President Biden to actually expect similar effort and focus and progress on CBDC, cryptos. I think that it will take all the goodwill of those who want to support sovereignty, who want to make sure that monetary policy can be transmitted properly using our currency, will endeavour.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S3.p16">
<p id="Ch4.S3.p16.1">She has expanded on these points saying in a video interview that the digital euro will be decided in October 2023. If passed, the current paradigm of cash spending and transfers will become even more restrictive. Lagarde justified the move by saying that she did not want the EU to be ‘dependent on the currency of an unfriendly country’ or a friendly currency activated by a private corporate entity’. She identified Meta, Google, and Amazon.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S3.p17">
<p id="Ch4.S3.p17.1">India has expressed far more interest in the technology, and of course their addressable market is huge! They have published a ‘<a href="https://twitter.com/RBI/status/1578329048446828544?" title="">concept note</a>’ in which they assert that a digital Rupee would be faster, cheaper, and easier to maintain. The key difference in India’s situation is the large areas of the rural population where mobile internet is more patchy. In such situations a cash equivalent stablecoin token with cash finality which can be transferred between mobile phone wallets <span id="Ch4.S3.p17.1.1">without</span> an internet connection is a huge boon. It seems very likely that India is moving to react to the innovation threat posed by cryptocurrencies to their own cash infrastructure. They are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2RQ0WO" title="">piloting the technology</a> already. Similarly there seems to be a strong, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-06/nigeria-limits-cash-transactions-to-push-enaira-and-other-payments" title="">predictably illiberal</a> push for transition to digital money in Nigeria.

<div id="Ch4.S3.p18">
<p id="Ch4.S3.p18.1">In the USA this text from Congressman Tom Emmer shows how complex and interesting this debate is becoming.<span id="Ch4.S3.p18.1.1">“Today, I introduced a bill prohibiting the Fed from issuing a central bank digital currency directly to individuals. Here’s why it matters: As other countries, like China, develop CBDCs that fundamentally omit the benefits and protections of cash, it is more important than ever to ensure the United States’ digital currency policy protects financial privacy, maintains the dollar’s dominance, and cultivates innovation.
<br>CBDCs that fail to adhere to these three basic principles could enable an entity like the Federal Reserve to mobilize itself into a retail bank, collect personally identifiable information on users, and track their transactions indefinitely.
<br>Not only does this CBDC model raise “single point of failure” issues, leaving Americans’ financial information vulnerable to attack, but it could be used as a surveillance tool that Americans should never be forced to tolerate from their own government.
<br>Requiring users to open an account at the Fed to access a United States CBDC would put the Fed on an insidious path akin to China’s digital authoritarianism.
<br>Any CBDC implemented by the Fed must be open, permissionless, and private. This means that any digital dollar must be accessible to all, transact on a blockchain that is transparent to all, and maintain the privacy elements of cash.
<br>In order to maintain the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency in a digital age, it is important that the United States lead with a posture that prioritizes innovation and does not aim to compete with the private sector.
<br>Simply put, we must prioritize blockchain technology with American characteristics, rather than mimic China’s digital authoritarianism out of fear.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S3.p19">
<p id="Ch4.S3.p19.1">Most analysts now seem to think that there is little appetite to replace established ’Western’ cash with CBDCs. Most significantly such products would need the support of retail banks, and it is not in their interest to service such a product. Their business model relies on using retail deposits for providing loans, and it is these deposits, not cash itself that would be the most addressable market for a CBDC. Banks don’t want people to self custody money. In addition it exposes the whole banking system to a higher risk of bank runs. Such a self custody, interest bearing, central government backed asset would have significantly less counterparty risk than even bank deposits, and at times of high systemic stress it seems likely that money would flow to where it’s thought safest, exposing the retail banks to runs. Fabio Panetta of the ECB said: <span id="Ch4.S3.p19.1.1">“If we give access to a means of payment, which is relatively limited, there are no transaction costs because you only need to have a smartphone. There will be risks that people could use this possibility to move, for example, their deposits of other banks or their money out of financial intermediates.”</span> - All of the proposed solutions to these problems such as caps and negative interest penalties seem poorly thought through.
Held and Smolenski present a <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/articles/why-the-u-s-should-reject-central-bank-digital-currencies" title="">detailed and rigorous negative critique</a> of the dystopian ramifications of the technology. In their conclusion they point out that: <span id="Ch4.S3.p19.1.2">“Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) represent an extension of state control over economic life. CBDCs provide governments with direct access to every transaction in that currency conducted by any individual anywhere in the world. As governments worldwide routinely share data with one another, individual transaction data will quickly become known to any government in a datasharing arrangement. Given the frequency with which government databases are compromised, this arrangement virtually ensures that anyone’s transaction data will eventually become available for global perusal.”</span></p></div>

This ledger would enable smart contract functionality similar to Ethereum on a global scale.

The stated aim is to enhance interoperability, efficiency, and safety in cross-border payments, while allowing individual nations to maintain capital controls and limits on the flow of funds. The IMF envision a permissioned (closed, but distributed) ledger, perhaps controlled by a platform operator (in the manner of SWIFT), to ensure unique ownership descriptions and prevent double spending. They emphasized the need for maintaining capital controls during national financial crises.</p></div>

The test explored various CBDC use cases, including offline payments, retail transactions, and micropayments. The test focused on a centralized ledger hosted by the Bank of England and involved the development of API functionalities for different scenarios.

<p id="Ch4.S3.SS2.p3.1">In conclusion, the risks associated with CBDCs are significant and multi-faceted. It is (hopefully) more likely that a blend of stablecoins, private bank issued digital currency (with a yield incentive) and perhaps some limited CBDC, alongside the new contender Bitcoin, will present a new landscape of user choice. Different models of trust, insurance, yields, acceptability, and potentially privacy, will emerge.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S3.SS2.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S3.SS2.p4.1">Clearly a global, stable, wholly digital bearer asset in a native currency would ostensibly be the ideal integration for money in a metaverse application, but the whole concept seems deeply ‘wrong’, and it is likely that a transition to such a technology would be complex and painful. Either way, it is certainly not ready for consideration now.
It’s important that central banks and governments carefully consider these risks before introducing CBDCs, but it’s not clear this is happening. It is conceivable that by working closely with the private sector policy makers could minimize any negative impacts, ensuring that any new regulations are designed in a way that protects the rights and privacy of individuals, while also promoting financial stability and economic growth.

<h6>The Role of Tokenisation</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S3.SS2.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S3.SS2.SSSx1.p1.1">Tokenisation represents a paradigm shift from traditional cryptocurrencies. The concept was introduced and popularised by the wider cypto movement, and it’s somewhat absurd claims around ‘tokenising everything’. After this fab died down post the ‘initial coin offering’ craze of 2018 attention shifted elsewhere. Curiously however the ‘Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’ and the BIS have been focusing on resolving settlement issues within financial systems. It deviates from the blockchain dependency, (correctly) and simply offers a more streamlined approach to financial transactions. This innovation will notably be explored in the OCC’s tokenisation symposium held on February 8th 2024, with an aspiration of integrating different types of money and assets on a unified platform. The symposium, a public event featuring keynotes from prominent figures in the financial world, will highlight the burgeoning interest in tokenisation (<a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2023/nr-occ-2023-18.html" title="">OCC Tokenization Symposium Details</a>).</p></div>

<section id="Ch4.S3.SS2.SSSx2">
<h6>Implications and Potential Risks</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S3.SS2.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S3.SS2.SSSx2.p1.1">While tokenisation presents significant potential for improving transaction efficiency and reducing risk, it is not without its challenges. A key concern is the impact on the traditional financial sector and the regulatory complexities it introduces. The integration of diverse forms of digital assets on a unified platform necessitates robust regulatory frameworks to ensure stability and prevent misuse.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S3.SS2.SSSx2.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S3.SS2.SSSx2.p2.1">In truth this, like the global push toward central bank digital currency, seems inspired by but asymptotic to the concept of cryptocurrencies. They are important technologies to consider as digital society tooling evolved, but they remain curiously far behind the retail technologies which spawned them. As the banking sector evolves with technological advancements, the role of tokenisation and its interaction with existing financial systems become increasingly crucial. The potential for a more efficient, secure, and integrated global financial system is evident, yet the path to achieving this is laden with regulatory, technical, and ethical challenges. The success of tokenisation initiatives will largely depend on the collaborative efforts of regulatory bodies, financial institutions, and technology experts to navigate these challenges effectively.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>4.4.1 </span>Spending it</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p1.1">Since this book seeks to examine transfer of value within a purely digital environment it is necessary to ask the question of whether Bitcoin is money. This short <a href="https://bitcoin-zar.blogspot.com/2018/07/duality-excerpt-by-satoshi-nakomoto.html" title="">‘story’</a>, purportedly written by Nakamoto, is a fabulous look at the money values of the technology, irrespective if it’s provenance. In it is the following text: <span id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p1.1.1">“Here, for once, was this idea that you could generate your own form of money. That’s the primary and sole reason, is because it was related to this thing called money. It wasn’t about the proficiency of the code or the novelty, it was because it had to do with money. It centered around money. That is something people cared about. After all, plenty of projects on Sourceforge at the time were just as well coded, well maintained, if not better, by teams, and even if someone else had created the blockchain before me, had it been used for something else beyond currency, it probably would not have had much of an outcome.</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p2.1">Again, irrespective of the author here, this point seems to ring true. The memetic power of Bitcoin is in it’s proximity to ‘money’, and the potential of the separation of money from the state.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p3.1">It is beyond argument that the Bitcoin network is a rugged message passing protocol which achieves a high degree of consensus about the entries on it’s distributed database.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p4.1">Ascribing monetary value to those database entries is a social consensus problem, and this itself is a contested topic. The most useful ‘hot take’ here is that Bitcoin behaves most like <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1395788419301773312" title="">a ‘property’</a>, while it’s network behaves far more like a monetary network which is created and supported by the <a href="https://saito.tech/an-response-to-paul-krugman-from-a-keynesian-bitcoiner/" title="">value of the Bitcoin tokens</a>.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p5.3">Mallers has recently announced USA focused partnerships which leverage his Strike product to enable spending Bitcoin, through Lightning, as Dollars in much of the <a href="https://www.ncr.com/point-of-sale-pos-systems" title="">point of sale</a> infrastructure in the USA. This is a huge advance as it immediately enables the vendors both online and at physical locations to either save 3% costs for card processors, or else pass this on as a discount. Crucially for ‘Bitcoin as a money’ it also allows the vendors to receive the payment <span id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p5.3.1">as</span> Bitcoin, not Dollars. A possible further and highly significant feature is that it might now be possible to divest of Bitcoin in the USA, buying goods, without a capital gains tax implication. Mallers claims to have legislative backing for this product, but the devil will likely be in the detail. The likely mechanism for this product is that the EPOS partner sends a Lighting request to Strike, which liquidates some of their Bitcoin holding to a dollar denominated stablecoin, but in a tax free jurisdiction such as El Salvador. This stablecoin will then be sent to the EPOS handing partner such as NCR. Stablecoin to Dollar transactions in the USA are much murkier and likely don’t cost anything for these companies. This agent will then authorise the Dollar denominated sale to the American digital till. Crucially nobody has a US capital gains tax exposure in this chain, and all of the settlements were near free, and instantaneous, with ‘cash finality’ for everyone except the EPOS company. They are likely actually exposed to a small risk here because uptake will be very low level. The novelty opportunity will likely cover any potential exposure to stablecoin collapse. This is a radical upgrade on the normal flow of divesting Bitcoin for American users.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p6">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p6.1">Using this open product to spend Bitcoin as Bitcoin to vendors might be available through Shopify globally. Again, it’s too new to be sure. Promisingly a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology/us-cons-merchant-getting-ready-for-crypto.pdf" title="">Deloitte study</a> has found that 93% of businesses accepting Bitcoin have seen revenue and brand perception improve, and 75% of USA sales execs plan to accept digital assets at some point in the next 2 years. This ambition in the US markets is likely to benefit from the proposed $200 tax exempt law for purchasing goods and services with Bitcoin.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p7">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p7.1">Of these recent developments in Lightning <a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1512188883101966351" title="">Lyn Alden says</a>: <span id="Ch4.S4.SS1.p7.1.1">Some people naturally dismiss [strike] because they don’t want to spend their BTC; they want to save it. However, the more places that accepted BTC at point of sale (on-chain or Lightning or otherwise), the more permissionless the whole network is. This is because, if all you can do with BTC is convert it back into fiat on a major exchange, then it’s easy to isolate it, effectively blacklist addresses, etc. But if you can directly spend it on goods and services across companies and jurisdictions, it’s harder to isolate. There are now plenty of vendors that make this easy for merchants to implement, and the merchant can still receive dollars if they want (rather than BTC), or can decide their % split. Since it’s an open network, anyone can build on it, globally. And then when you add fiat-to-BTC-to-fiat payments over Lightning, it gets even more interesting because it doesn’t necessarily need to be a taxable event. Lightning wallets with a BTC balance and a USD/stablecoin balance. Lower fees than Visa and others.</span></p></div>

<h6>African adoption</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS1.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS1.SSSx1.p1.1">Africa has one of the most fragmented banking, payment, and currency systems in the world, which makes simple financial tasks like paying a bill, sending money, or accepting money extremely difficult. Over half of Africa does not have access to a bank account, so people hold and save everything in cash, which is often stolen and loses value due to inflation. It is also difficult to get money in and out of many African countries because only about 40% of people have active internet access, and must rely on financial institutions. Bitcoin is being used in Africa as an alternative form of money that resolves these issues. It is being taught in education centers in underdeveloped areas, giving children the opportunity to learn about and use Bitcoin as a way to access financial services that have been unavailable to them for generations. However, the rest of the country may have difficulty implementing the use of Bitcoin due to issues such as a lack of electricity and internet access, as well as government policies that centralize power.</p></div>

<h6>Bitcoin based FIAT</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS1.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS1.SSSx2.p1.1">More interestingly for metaverse applications Mallers has opened this section of the company to interact with the public Lightning network, allowing people with a self hosted wallet or node to pay directly for goods across America, settling immediately in Dollars, using their Bitcoin, at zero cost. <span id="Ch4.S4.SS1.SSSx2.p1.1.1">This opens the possibility to buy from US based (Dollar denominated) metaverse stores, using the capabilities of the stack assembled at the end of the book</span>. The implications globally are unclear at this time.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S4.SS1.SSSx2.p2.1"><a href="https://stablesats.com/" title="">Stablesats</a> is another approach which uses exclusively lightning bitcoin but makes the value stable against the US dollar using an algorithm. This is a very interesting option and will be explored in detail at some point.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p2.1">The following paraphrases Eric Yakes, author of <a href="https://yakes.io/book/" title="">‘The 7th Property’</a>. Again, this is an Austrian economics perspective, and like much economic theory the underlying premise <a href="https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/do-you-understand-the-austrian-vs-keynesian-economic-debate-2f4b152c6a6b" title="">is contested</a><cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx122" title="">122</a>]</cite>: <span id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p2.1.1">“Paper became money because it was superior to gold in terms of divisibility and portability BUT it lacked scarcity. People reasoned that we could benefit from the greater divisibility/portability of paper money as long as it was redeemable in a form of money that was scarce. This is when money needed to be “backed” by something. 
<br>Since we changed money to paper money that wasn’t scarce, it needed to be backed by something that was. Since the repeal of the gold standard, politicians have retarded the meaning of the word because our money is no longer backed by something scarce.
<br>So, what is bitcoin backed by? Nothing.
<br>Sound money, like gold, isn’t “backed”.
Only money that lacks inherent monetary properties must be backed by another money that maintains those properties. The idea that our base layer money needs to be backed by something is thinking from the era of paper money. Bitcoin does not require backing, it has inherent monetary properties superior to any other form of money that has ever existed.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p3.1">The 2022 ARK Big Ideas report again provides some useful market insight. They posit that demand for the money features of Bitcoin could drive the price of the capped supply tokens to around 1M pounds per Bitcoin as in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch4.F5" title="Figure 4.5 ‣ 4.4.2 Saving with it ‣ 4.4 Bitcoin as a money ‣ Chapter 4 Money in the real world ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>4.5</span></a>.

<div id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p4.1">Perhaps more than any of these takes, it is worth considering the current public perception of the technology as a money and store of value. This <a href="https://twitter.com/saquon/status/1480738426236375041" title="">twitter thread</a> from professional sportsman Saquon Barkley, to his half million followers on the platform, captures the mood. He is one of a handful of athletes now being <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/athletes/" title="">paid directly</a> in Bitcoin.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p5.1"><span id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p5.1.1">“I want my career earnings to last generations. The average NFL career is 3 years and inflation is real. Saving and preserving money over time is hard, no matter who you are.
In today’s world: How do we save? This is why I believe in bitcoin. Almost all professional athletes make the majority of their career earnings in their 20s. With a lack of education, inaccessible tools, and inflation, a sad yet common reality is many enter bankruptcy later on. We can do better. We need to improve financial literacy. Bitcoin is a proven, safe, global, and open system that allows anyone to save money. It is the most accessible asset we’ve ever seen.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p6">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p6.1">This ubiquity of access is what probably most distinguishes Bitcoin. Previously it could be argued that only the most wealthy could access the ‘means’ to store their labour without loss of value over time (through inflation). To be clear, inflation is an important part of the money system, somewhat within the control of the central banks, and approximate to taxation. It applies equally to all holders of the money supply. Asserting that money should be replaced by a ‘hard asset’ such as Bitcoin, in the place of the more controllable utility of money, is likely both a fantasy, and wrong minded. This conflation of money and property is a confusion caused by Bitcoin’s proximity to money, and it’s ‘money like’ network, and is extremely commonplace.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p7">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p7.1">These narrative takes are all rooted in the popular idea that Bitcoin is a ‘hedge against inflation’; an increasingly fragile take, as the price plummets with global markets. The Bitcoin community seems somewhat confused about the nature of money, which is predictable because we can see in these sections that money is pretty confusing. Money is the fluid, elastic <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx123" title="">123</a>]</cite>, and thin ‘working credit’ layer on top of historical human production, which provides transaction convenience, and tools for credit. Value is effectively swapped in and out of this layer through the actions of central banks, controlling inflation into acceptable margins. Simplistically this is done through manipulation of interest rates (the easiness of credit), quantitative easing (buying of assets) and quantitative tightening (selling of assets). To give a quick high level view of central bank activity we can use the PESTLE framework:</p><ul id="Ch4.S4.I4">

<p id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p7.2">Fiat money is primarily <span id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p7.2.1">not</span> a long term store of value, as Austrian economists perhaps believe it should be. This function is left to assets. The Austrian thesis of ‘hard money’ (which cannot be ‘debased’ by government action) seems somewhat naive when one considers that if credit exists anywhere in the world (ie, the creation of paper money through loans) then this would be used to buy up a hard money asset in the long run, causing a scarcity crisis. This is what happened to gold in the middle of the last century.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p8">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p8.1">Fundamentally, Bitcoin isn’t money (in the traditional sense) because it’s not an IOU, which money certainly is. It’s a bearer instrument, novel asset class, with money like properties, as identified above. As said again and again it functions most like a ‘property’ which can be invested in by anyone, with all the attendant risks of that property class to the holder. Lyn Alden says it sits <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/what-is-money/" title="">somewhere between</a> a saving tool, and an investment, acting as “programmable commodity money”.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p9">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p9.1"><a href="https://andrewmbailey.com/" title="">Andrew M. Bailey</a> says <span id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p9.1.1">“in an ideal world where governments honour the rights of citizens, they don’t spy, they don’t prohibit transactions, they manage a sound money supply, and they make sound decisions, the value of bitcoin is very low; we’re just not in an ideal world”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p10">
<p id="Ch4.S4.SS2.p10.1">Another potentially important differentiating affordance is censorship resistance. There’s really nothing else like it for that one feature. With that said Bitcoin is only a viable ‘money like thing’ when viewed in the layers described in this book, <a href="https://giacomozucco.com/layers-before-bitcoin" title="">and elsewhere</a><cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx124" title="">124</a>]</cite>. The base chain layer is an apex secure store of value. Whatever layer 2 ultimately emerges is the transactional layer which could replace day to day cash money, while the hypothetical layer 3 might be useful for complex financial mechanisms and contracts operating automatically, and also provides the opportunity for using the security model of the chain to support other digital assets, including government currencies through stablecoins. All these things have a natural home in borderless social spaces.</p></div>

<h6>Geopolitics</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx1.p1.1">It can be seen that following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, that sanctions of various kinds were applied to the Russian economy. One of these was the previously dicussed Swift international settlement network. Another whole catagory was the removal of support by private businesses domiciled outside of Russia and Ukraine, and pertinent here is that VISA, Mastercard, Paypal, and Western Union all removed support for their product rails. This means that while some cards and services still work, and will likely work again through Chinese proxies in the coming months, considerable disruption will be felt by Russian companies and individuals. This is not to say that this disruption is necessarily wrong, but it is clear now that all of these global financial transfer products and services are contingent on political factors. The same might be true of CBDC products if they gain traction globally. There is certainly no reason why all money within a physically delineated border could not be blocked or cancelled. This is not as true for Bitcoin at this time.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx1.p2.1">However, with enough political will it is technically plausible to incentivise miners with additional payments to exclude transactions from geolocated wallets. This would be mitigated by Tor, and in a global anonymous network it is very likely that a miner could be found at a higher price for inclusion in the next block.</p></div>

<h6>Capture by traditional finance</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx2.p1.1">As the popularity of Bitcoin continues to grow, traditional financial market incumbents have begun to take notice. In an effort to assert their dominance and protect their interests, these incumbents have turned to regulation and acquisition as means of capturing the growing markets. This is most clear in the ’alt coin’ space where traditional banks have leveraged their knowledge and marketing to transfer money from retail investors into their own venture capital operations. This is not to say that Bitcoin is immune from these harms.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx2.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx2.p2.1">One way that traditional financial market incumbents have sought to capture the bitcoin market is through the use of regulatory frameworks. By working with government agencies (as described in previous chapters), to develop and implement regulations governing the use and trade of cryptocurrencies, these incumbents are able to limit competition and control the flow of capital into and out of the markets. They are also able to “print paper bitcoin”, running a fractional reserve operation, as happened in the FTX/Alameda fiasco.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx2.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx2.p3.1">We have already described how, in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has implemented regulations governing the issuance and trading of bitcoin-based securities. These regulations, which require issuers of bitcoin-based securities to register with the SEC and comply with a variety of reporting and disclosure requirements, have effectively made it difficult for small and independent players to enter the market.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx2.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx2.p4.1">Another way that traditional financial market incumbents have sought to capture the bitcoin market is through the use of partnerships and acquisitions. As the newer companies stumble and fail as a result of poor risk management and over-leverage it seems that Wall Street incumbents like Goldman Sax are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/goldman-sachs-hunt-bargain-crypto-firms-after-ftx-fiasco-2022-12-06/" title="">taking advantage of the opportunity</a> at structural scale. By acquiring existing crypto companies, these incumbents are able to gain access to the technology, expertise, and customer base of these companies, giving them a significant advantage over their competitors.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx2.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx2.p5.1">For example, in 2017, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) partnered with the CBOE to launch bitcoin futures trading. This partnership allowed the CME and CBOE to tap into the growing market for bitcoin derivatives, while also providing a means for traditional financial market participants to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to hold the underlying asset. This is a crucial risk to the emerging technology as ownership of the underlying asset (self custody) was supposed to be the whole point of the technology. Ben Hunt of epsilon theory recently said: <span id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx2.p5.1.1">“..if you don’t see that the crypto quote-unquote industry has become just as blindingly corrupt as the traditional Financial Services industry it was supposed to replace well you’re just not paying attention what made Bitcoin special is nearly lost and what remains is a false and constructed narrative that exists in service to Wall Street in Washington rather than in resistance; the Bitcoin narrative must be renewed and that will change everything”</span>

<h6>Liquidity Lottery</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx3.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx3.p1.1">Because holders of BTC are disincentived to sell the asset (assuming future gains) it is likely vulnerable to something <a href="https://twitter.com/UrbanKaoboy/status/1526311908709502977" title="">Kao called the ‘liquidity lottery’</a>. This is a supply/demand mismatch which he thinks could spell the end of the asset class in time. Macro analyst group <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/" title="">‘Doomberg’</a> believe that this mispricing of the asset is the significant risk, and point out that if Bitcoin is approached within the framework of government controlled Fiat, then there is no <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/there_is_no_there_there" title="">‘there there’</a>. Bitcoin does not generate more fiat money within it’s ecosystem (as say an energy extraction company would), and as such is very suggestive of the features of a Ponzi. They have recently softened on this view, and are now clear to separate Bitcoin from the wider ‘crypto’ world, which they remain convinced are simply scams, wash trading magic beans without any productivity. The value is dependent on finding the ‘greater fool’ mentioned near the start of the book. <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/dollars-ex-machina" title="">Doomberg assert</a> that the price of the asset has been inflated by manipulation in the unregulated stablecoin markets (specifically Tether), and in the event of a ‘run for the exits’ there would be a serious repricing. This seems entirely possible, and perhaps even likely, below an unknown threshold of confidence. They are now asserting that if the manipulation and mispricing could be ‘washed out’ of Bitcoin then it would present an investment opportunity, and they estimate that price at around $3000. We think that the combination of global speed of exchange of value, generative AI, and bots which leverage the network to create value within the ecosystem of the network, that this thesis does not stand true, but there is no way to know for sure at this time.</p></div>

<section id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx4">
<h6>Manipulation of price or the network</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx4.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx4.p1.1">Bitcoin is still young and illiquid enough to be highly manipulable. Imagine for instance if a major organisation or nation state wished to accumulate a significant amount of the asset, but would prefer a lower price.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx4.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx4.p2.1">There is an unknown level of exposure to risk from centralised mining. If a few of the major mining pools were simultaneously infiltrated by a nation state actor then it might be possible to engineer a ‘deep re-org’ of a large transaction. This would be dealt with quickly and almost certainly be a transient attack, but the damage to the narrative might be substantial. The proposed solution to this known vulnerability is called <a href="https://braiins.com/stratum-v2" title="">‘Stratum V2’</a> in which the transaction in the blocks would be organised by pool miners or their delegates, with an increase in efficiency as a driving incentive. A similar vulnerability exists in the centralisation at the level of internet service providers <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx84" title="">84</a>]</cite>. This or some other flaw might lead to a selling cascade. Nobody knows just how vulnerable to selling cascades Bitcoin might be against a really serious challenge by an empowered actor, but it’s already high volatility is suggestive of risk.</p></div>

<h6>Rehypothecation</h6>

<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx5.p1.1">It’s vulnerable to rehypothecation (paper bitcoin managed by centralised entities running a fractional reserve). It seems that Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch4.F6" title="Figure 4.6 ‣ Rehypothecation ‣ 4.5.1 Risks to Bitcoin the money ‣ 4.5 Risks (money, not technical) ‣ Chapter 4 Money in the real world ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>4.6</span></a> by Nassim Taleb is a cautionary tale <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx125" title="">125</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<h6>Scale</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx6.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx6.p1.1">Scalability is always going to be a problem for Bitcoin, for all the reasons discussed in the blockchain chapter. There is no “ready to go” solution (except perhaps federations) that could onboard the whole world at this time because of the limited number of available UTXOs.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx6.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx6.p2.1">Finally, a lack of fungibility, and privacy by default in Bitcoin, trends towards blacklists and over time this could seriously compromise the use of the asset.</p></div>

<h6>Centralisation of the money over time</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx7.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS1.SSSx7.p1.1">In a medium term future it’s possible to imagine a smart enough autonomous AI or ML actor managing to accrue Bitcoin through fast and smart ‘decisions’. This could unreasonably centralise the asset, and it would be impossible to claw this situation back. These constructs would last for the lifetime of the chain unless constrained by timelock multisigs for instance.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S5.SS2.SSSx5.p1.1">In the event of an existential collapse of the Bitcoin network the erasure of so much capital would certainly have a contagion effect on the whole global financial system. It’s hard to imagine what such an event could be, this being the nature of “black swans”. One cited example is the unravelling of cryptography by quantum computing. Some conspiracy theorists in the past have even speculated that Bitcoin is itself a canary in the coal mine, engineered by the NSA to warn about emergent quantum computing somewhere in the world. It’s all pretty silly because without cryptography Bitcoin would be the least of humanities problems. The risk of ‘something’ does exist though.

The was obviously a great design choice for the computer scientists trying to solve the problem of a secure, and scalable, electronic cash, which couldn’t be confiscated. Ironically for a global consensus mechanism it seems that nobody wants to discuss what constitutes a successful end point to this, and especially not what ‘successful’ endpoints for the game theory which have calamitous negative repercussions for wider society look like <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx126" title="">126</a>]</cite>.

<h6>National security / actual warfare</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S5.SS2.SSSx9.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS2.SSSx9.p1.1">There’s some national security implications for Bitcoin which are discussed both in the <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery/status/1512775981693648897?" title="">fringes</a> and the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/04/04/why-bitcoin-mining-is-a-matter-of-national-security/" title="">sector media</a>. Essentially, the industrial mining complexes which are more commonplace now, are easily identifiable targets, and provide nations with both some leverage over the global network, and a considerable source of income. The IMF correctly identifies these facilities as a way for nation states to <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2022/04/19/global-financial-stability-report-april-2022" title="">monetise their energy reserves</a> without the need for foreign markets, opening the door to sanction avoidance. In the case of smaller and developing nation states who are perhaps subject to financial penalties on the global stage for whatever reason, these facilities start to look like legitimate targets for cyber and conventional warfare. Lowry explain the potential strategic importance of Bitcoin in Softwar <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx33" title="">33</a>]</cite>, though to be clear his motives are unclear and his thesis is neither peer reviewed nor publicly accessible.

<p id="Ch4.S5.SS2.SSSx10.p1.1">Bitcoin’s online community skews very hard toward right wing libertarianism. This isn’t to say there are no other voices, but they are certainly outnumbered. This imbalance is almost certainly a product of the ESG concerns around the technology. There has been a notable increase in diversity of thought since the evolution of the energy narrative, but it persists. This leads to a paucity of voices in policy making circles, and in the USA a strong delineation between policy makers along party lines. This kind of thing tends to be self reinforcing, and it seems very possible that the global liberal left will swing mainly against the technology, while the neoliberal right will be attracted more to it. As tensions increase so it seems does the online rhetoric. Even scientists now seem to agree that Bitcoin investors are calculating psychopaths <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx127" title="">127</a>]</cite>.

<div id="Ch4.S5.SS2.SSSx13.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S5.SS2.SSSx13.p1.1">All of the above starts to look like convergence on something the crypto community regularly describes to itself within it’s internal media. Hyperbitcoinization is a term coined in 2014 by Daniel Krawisz <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx130" title="">130</a>]</cite>. It is the hypothetical rise of Bitcoin to become the global reserve currency, and the demonetisation of all other store of value assets. This seems unlikely but is hinted at in a game theoretic analysis of both Bitcoin and current macro economics. Again, Bitcoin is a likely very poor replacement for money. The ability to monetise assets through banks, backed by law and contracts (the debt based system), is a highly refined human concept, while Bitcoin is a fusion of Austrian economics, and a computer science project. The hyperbitcoinization idea finds it’s ultimate expression in Svalholm’s “Everything Divided by 21 Million”, a hypothetical re-accounting of all human production into the Bitcoin ledger <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx131" title="">131</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

In a hyperbitcoinised world where debt law would be enforced by distributed code, it might be far harder to prevent the “fall of Rome” scenario he describes. It is notable that he is also <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/09/autocomplete-worshippers/#the-real-ai-was-the-corporations-that-we-fought-along-the-way" title="">strongly opposed</a> to the current hype in AI and it’s possible this is just his stock in trade.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>4.6 </span>Is DeFi any use?</h4>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p1.1">DeFi is decentralised finance, and might only exist because of partial regulatory capture of Bitcoin. If peer-to-peer Bitcoin secured yield and loans etc were allowed then it seems unlikely that the less secure and more convoluted DeFi products would have found a footing. DeFi has been commonplace over the last couple years, growing from <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/state-of-crypto-report-a16z-2022/" title="">essentially zero to $100B</a> over the last two or three. It enables trading of value, loans, and interest (yield) without onerous KYC. If Bitcoin’s ethos is to develop at a slow and well checked rate, and Ethereum’s ethos is to move fast and break things, then DeFi could best be described as throwing mud and hoping some sticks. A counter to this comes from Ross Stevens, head of NYDig <a href="https://nydig.com/on-impossible-things-before-breakfast" title="">who says</a> <span id="Ch4.S6.p1.1.1">“The concept of decentralized finance is powerful, noble, and worthy of a lifetime of focused effort.”</span>. This may be true in principle, but certainly isn’t the case as things stand.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p2.1">According to a recent JPMorgan industry insider report, around 40% of the locked value on the Ethereum network is DeFi products. It is characterised by rapid innovation, huge yields for early adopters, incredibly high risk, and a culture of speculation which leads to products being discarded and/or forked into something else in the pursuit of returns. Ethereum also allows miners of the blockchain to cheat the system <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx134" title="">134</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p3.1">Much of the space is now using arcane gamification of traditional financial tools, combined with memes, to promote what are essentially pyramid schemes. Scams are very commonplace. Loss of funds though code errors are perhaps even more prevalent.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p4.1">The Bank for International Settlements have the stated aim of supporting central banks monetary and financial stability. Their <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2112b.pdf" title="">2021 report on DeFi</a> noted the following key problems.</p><ul id="Ch4.S6.I1">
<li id="Ch4.S6.I1.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S6.I1.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S6.I1.i1.p1.1">..a “decentralisation illusion” in DeFi due to the inescapable need for centralised governance and the tendency of blockchain consensus mechanisms to concentrate power. DeFi‘s inherent governance structures are the natural entry points for public policy.</p></div>

<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S6.I1.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S6.I1.i2.p1.1">DeFi’s vulnerabilities are severe because of high leverage, liquidity mismatches, built-in interconnectedness and the lack of shock-absorbing capacity.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch4.S6.p4.2">These are two excellent and likely true points. European Parliament Vice President <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wef-2022-most-defi-protocols-aren-t-really-decentralized-says-european-parliament-vp?" title="">Eva Kaili made this same point</a> at the World Economic Forum, so clearly regulators are aware of the lack of meaningful distribution in DeFi. In addition access to DeFi is ‘usually’ through web.0 centralised portals (websites) which are just as vulnerable to legal takedown orders as any other centralised technology. Given who the major investment players seem to be in this ‘new’ financial landscape it seems very likely that regulatory capture is coming. The seemingly unironic trend towards CeDeFi (<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cedefi-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters" title="">centralised decentralised finance</a>) illustrates this.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p5.1">With this said, it is notable that in the wake of the FTX debacle and unwinding of counter party risk across the whole extended ecosystem, it is DeFi which seems to have fared best, suggesting there might be a viable product here in the end. Circle and DeFi infrastructure lab Uniswap have recently published a paper which asserts that use of the technology could de-risk foreign exchange markets <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx135" title="">135</a>]</cite>. It feels regrettably close to the endless broken promises of ‘blockchain for remittance’ which have circulated for a decade <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx136" title="">136</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx137" title="">137</a>]</cite>. They estimate that it may be possible to cut the costs of cross border remittances by 80% This is a big claim and time will tell.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p6">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p6.1">There are more recent DeFi on Bitcoin contenders, but these are vulnerable to the <a href="https://bisq.community/t/trading-halted-until-v1-3-0-hotfix/9208" title="">same attacks</a> and problems in the main.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p7">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p7.1">There is likely no use for this technology for small and medium sized companies on the international stage, at least until the proposed Forex integrations appear. It is far more likely that reputation would be damaged. It’s possible to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/20/the-credit-crunch-is-not-the-end-of-crypto-lending/" title="">get loans</a> (by extension business loans) out of such systems at relatively low risks. The best ‘distributed’ example of this is probably <a href="https://lend.hodlhodl.com/" title="">Lend, at HODLHODL</a>, which is a peer-to-peer loan marketplace. <a href="https://atomic.finance/blog/a-laypersons-guide-to-discreet-log-contracts-atomic-yield-series-part-3/" title="">Atomic Finance</a> leverages <a href="https://adiabat.github.io/dlc.pdf" title="">discrete log contracts</a> amongst other more edge uses of Bitcoin, to provide financial services without custody of the users’ Bitcoin. It is possible to make the argument that between hodlhodl loans, taro asset issuance, boltz exchange, and lightning escrow that all of the “classes” of DeFi smart contract can be serviced already by Bitcoin alone, but this tech is fringe at best.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p8">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p8.1">Many more custodial options exist for loans (CASA, Nexo, Ledn, Abra etc). These might not really fit the definition of DeFi at all. Many of these centralised DeFi companies (CeDeFi) have imploded in the wake of the Terra/Luna collapse since they were generating yield from one another and ultimately Terra. The maxim seems to be that if you don’t know how the system is monetised then you are likely the product. As mentioned, DeFi itself weathered the recent market turmoil comparatively well and it’s possible that as these products evolve they may be useful to companies who have Bitcoin and stablecoins on their balance sheet long term. Dan Held maintains an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZoapTCl76wahFMeNISSx9UdC3QBx-zC_jY4Le1H5Sdg/htmlview#" title="">online spreadsheet</a> which compares these products.</p></div>

In his latest book, Runciman, professor of Politics at Cambridge University, traces contemporary anxieties about artificial intelligence back centuries to the origins of the modern state and corporation. There are interesting an striking parallels between the apparatus of state, and the emergent field of AI.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p10">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p10.1">In the 17th century, Thomas Hobbes described the ideal state as a kind of "automaton" - a human-made machine that could provide stability and security beyond fickle, emotional human politics. Later, the invention of the limited liability corporation allowed artificial entities to take on previously unthinkable risks and debts. Runciman argues that states and corporations function essentially as “robots” - artificial, human-made creations constructed to make decisions and take actions. Much like our worries about AI today, these entities were designed to take over certain tasks and responsibilities from human hands.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p11">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p11.1">States and corporations have acquired immense, sometimes unchecked power, persisting and protecting themselves as emergent features of their creation. They remain fundamentally inhuman; they do not think, feel, or have a conscience as individual humans do. Runciman suggests that the story of the modern world is the story of handing over decision-making and control to these robots, AI and systemic alike.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p12">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p12.1">Today, our prosperity, health, and safety depend deeply on these state and corporate machines. Yet Runciman warns they could also lead to catastrophe if we fail to maintain control. Their vast powers, from mass surveillance to nuclear weapons, remind us of their inhuman, robotic nature. Runciman argues we must focus not just on regulating new AI, but on democratizing and improving oversight over existing state and corporate "robots" we rely upon daily. More transparency, public input, and innovation in governance is needed to retain human agency. Though we created them, these powerful machines can take on a life of their own.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p13">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p13.1">This chapter attempts to speak to these issues, and the wider global need to reassert control over the human condition. We will start by looking at global economics, then talk briefly about the global approaches to AI which are emerging, before exploring AI in detail in it’s own chapter.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p14">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p14.1">Malone, an ex central banking analyst now working in crypto, links across the last two chapters of blockchain, and money, <a href="https://twitter.com/brendanpmalone/status/1628067806984937472" title="">in a Twitter thread</a>. He believes that policymakers should focus on the underlying problems in the financial system, rather than just focusing on crypto. He has a lot of appreciation for US policymakers worrying about risk in the financial system. Crypto gets attention because it’s an easy target, but Malone believes that the real problems are so much bigger. According to Malone, people want to hold USD money to store value and make payments. Most are familiar with cash and bank deposits, but there’s actually a spectrum of assets of varying quality that act like money, as we saw in the previous chapter. These include Euro dollars, repo, commercial paper, and more. This is what people are talking about when they reference the shadow banking system - money moving around the financial system outside of traditional banks, primarily in non-banks. As an aside, the name ‘euro dollar’ predates the Euro currency, and has nothing to do with it. The origins of the eurodollar market can be attributed to the Cold War in the 1950s. At that time, the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies began depositing their US dollar holdings in European banks, primarily in London, to avoid the risk of their assets being frozen by the US government. These dollar-denominated deposits held outside the United States became known as eurodollars. Malone notes that some amount of shadow banking activity is good because it allows the money supply to be more reactive and expand and contract with economic activity, which helps fuel economic growth. However, the regulatory and political apparatus and the underlying systems weren’t really designed for a system this large, opaque, and multi-dimensional. This was seen in 2008 and 2009, which was as much about shadow banking and financial plumbing as it was about subprime housing and complex derivatives. The same was seen in 2020 with COVID-19.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p15">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p15.1">In times of crisis, people want to be able to freely convert whatever they are holding into something safer on the spectrum. Sadly, sometimes market liquidity isn’t there, so the central banks and come to save the day, and this kicks the can down the road. The core issue is that people an institutions want to store capital in places they can’t access due to technical, institutional, or geopolitical reasons. Sovereigns hold US treasuries, hedge funds and HRTs use repo, and we have seen that the crypto and Bitcoin economies have stablecoins.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p16">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p16.1">Since 2008 and 2009, the Treasury Market has gotten significantly larger, more fragile, and more complex. Banks have even more restrictions on creating deposits, and the demand for safe assets keeps skyrocketing. On top of that, the geopolitical landscape has changed dramatically, with US sanctions and seizure of Russian USD assets. Malone notes that crypto is a response to these underlying problems. Although it is not perfect, it is getting better as people learn from past experiences and begin to build regulatory clarity. This issue of regulatory clarity leads us into this section of the book, which looks are implicit or explicit corruption of governance.&nbsp;As a uueful example; The New York Magazine article provided an in-depth interview with Gary Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in which he shared his thoughts on the cryptocurrency industry. One of the key takeaways was his belief that all cryptocurrencies, except for Bitcoin, should be considered securities, as they involve relying on the work of others to give them value. Gensler is an ex banker, and an ambitious politician, with his eyes on bigger prizes. He openly courted the attention of the now disgraced top team at FTX which failed so spectacularly. His assertions have sparked controversy, as it raises questions about the feasibility of registering all tokens as securities, given the unique challenges posed by open-source protocols and the changing nature of blockchain technologies. Critics argue that Gensler’s stance could harm innovation and capital formation, as companies and entrepreneurs may struggle to comply with onerous regulations or abandon their projects altogether. The current system simply doesn’t fit this new self forming marketplace, and his implication seems to be that the legal end game here is the destruction of the invested capital, because of non compliance. This has led to frustration and concern among crypto advocates and investors, who worry about the impact of such policies on the industry’s growth and development.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S6.p17">
<p id="Ch4.S6.p17.1">The discourse should be on the much more fundamental questions of the monetary system and fragility of past assumptions and their ability to predict what comes next. Even as these conversations happen, however, the Bitcoin and stable coin builders will keep building because they are not going to sit around and wait for solutions to be presented to them.</p></div>

<h6>Inequality on the Rise</h6>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS1.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS1.SSSx1.p1.1">In Britain inequality has returned to levels not seen since the 1930s. After steadily rising between 1600 to 1913, Britain’s wealth as a share of the global total peaked and then began falling until the end of the 1970s [ref required]. During this time, Britain became one of Europe’s most equal countries, even without the support of its Empire [ref needed]. Some argue this relative equality enabled Britain’s economic growth and international standing to keep pace with its European neighbours, despite the loss of imperial power [ref needed]. During this period there was much upheaval in global monetary systems. More recently we have seen that trust has diminished, and inequality has risen, with social media perhaps acting as an accelerator.</p></div>

<div id="Ch4.S7.SS2.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS2.p1.1">Four decades later, the social impacts of rising inequality are becoming clear. Of the 14 million people living in poverty in Britain today, most are in working families [ref needed]. Upward mobility is declining, as the continued dominance of the privately educated elite in top jobs hinders meritocracy [The Gender Wage Gap Among University Vice Chancellors in the UK

<p id="Ch4.S7.SS4.p1.1">Dorling [oxford, reference] Tackling inequality requires recognizing that excessive wealth concentration is detrimental to social cohesion and national prosperity. A modicum of inequality may be inevitable, but the widening chasm between rich and poor in Britain has passed sustainable limits. With common purpose and political will, a more equitable path is possible. As inequality lessened for decades before, supportive policies enabled the rise of a thriving middle class [The Persistence in Gendering: Work-Family Policy in Britain since Beveridge

<span>4.7.5 </span>Anacyclosis</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS5.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS5.p1.1">It’s interesting in the current global political moment to look briefly at Anacyclosis. This is a political theory attributed to the ancient Greek historian Polybius, which posits that political systems evolve in a cyclical manner. The theory is based on the observation that governments tend to progress through six stages, each corresponding to a specific form of governance: monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and ochlocracy (mob rule). These stages are organized into three pairs, with each pair consisting of a ’good’ form of governance and its corresponding ’bad’ form.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS5.p2">
<ul id="Ch4.S7.I1">
<li id="Ch4.S7.I1.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S7.I1.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.I1.i1.p1.1">Monarchy (benign) -&gt; Tyranny (corrupt): Monarchy is the rule by a single individual, such as a king or queen, who is considered to be a wise and benevolent ruler. However, as the monarchy endures, there is a risk that the ruler becomes corrupted or that a less competent or tyrannical successor takes over. This leads to tyranny, the degenerate form of monarchy, where the ruler becomes oppressive and self-serving.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch4.S7.I1.i2">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S7.I1.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.I1.i2.p1.1">Aristocracy (benign) -&gt; Oligarchy (corrupt): To counter the tyranny, a group of nobles or elites may overthrow the tyrant and establish an aristocracy, which is the rule by a select group of individuals who are considered wise and virtuous. Over time, the aristocracy may become more focused on their own interests and power, leading to an oligarchy. This is the degenerate form of aristocracy, where a small group of elites control the government for their own benefit.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch4.S7.I1.i3">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S7.I1.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.I1.i3.p1.1">Democracy (benign) -&gt; Ochlocracy (corrupt): The populace, dissatisfied with the oppressive rule of the oligarchs, may rise up and establish a democracy, which is the rule by the majority of the people through voting and participation in the political process. Democracy has the potential to create a fair and representative system of governance. However, as the democratic process becomes more susceptible to demagoguery, populism, and factionalism, it can devolve into ochlocracy or mob rule, where the government is influenced or controlled by unruly masses.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS5.p2.1">According to Polybius, these stages form a continuous cycle, as one form of governance gives way to another, and each form eventually becomes corrupted and degenerates into its corresponding ’bad’ form. The theory of anacyclosis suggests that political systems are inherently unstable, with each form of governance containing the seeds of its own destruction.</p></div>

<span>4.7.6 </span>The World Economic Forum</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p1.1">The World Economic Forum (WEF) is a non-governmental organization founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab. It is well known for its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where world leaders, CEOs, and various stakeholders gather to discuss global issues and potential solutions. Although the WEF does not have direct control over policymaking, its influence on global policy arises from its role as a platform for dialogue and idea exchange, as well as its ability to bring together influential individuals.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p2.1">As unelected technocrats, the WEF’s impact on global policy can be observed through these aspects:
</p><ul id="Ch4.S7.I2">
<li id="Ch4.S7.I2.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S7.I2.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.I2.i1.p1.1">Convening power: The WEF’s Davos meeting is a high-profile event that attracts prominent political figures, business executives, and other influential individuals. This ability to assemble people allows the WEF to initiate conversations on global issues, create networks, and establish connections among key players. These interactions can lead to ideas and initiatives that might eventually shape global policy.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch4.S7.I2.i2">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S7.I2.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.I2.i2.p1.1">Knowledge sharing and thought leadership: The WEF produces a range of publications, reports, and research that provide insights into various global challenges. By disseminating this knowledge, the WEF contributes to the broader understanding of complex issues and helps to inform policymaking by governments, businesses, and other organizations.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch4.S7.I2.i3">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S7.I2.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.I2.i3.p1.1">Agenda-setting: Through its conferences and publications, the WEF identifies and highlights emerging trends, risks, and opportunities, which can help to set the agenda for global policy discussions. By bringing attention to specific issues, the WEF can indirectly influence the priorities of governments and other decision-makers.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch4.S7.I2.i4">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S7.I2.i4.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.I2.i4.p1.1">Public-private cooperation: The WEF actively promotes collaboration between the public and private sectors in addressing global challenges. By fostering partnerships and facilitating dialogue between these sectors, the WEF can help drive the development and implementation of policies that require cooperation between governments, businesses, and civil society.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p2.2">Despite its influence, critics argue that the WEF’s position as unelected technocrats raises concerns about the organization’s legitimacy and accountability. They contend that the WEF’s ability to shape global policy without being directly answerable to citizens can undermine democratic processes and result in policies that prioritize the interests of elites over the broader public. However, others argue that the WEF’s role in facilitating dialogue and collaboration is essential for tackling complex global challenges that require coordinated action across sectors and borders.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p3.1">Interesting for us the WEF recently released its annual <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf" title="">Global Risks Report</a>, which highlights various threats and challenges facing the world today, and which intersect with all of the narratives in this book. The report discusses issues related to cybersecurity, public trust, and social cohesion, and underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to addressing these challenges.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p4.1">The WEF’s founder, Klaus Schwab, has previously argued for a “great reset” in society and the economy, which involves revamping various aspects of our lives, from education to social contracts and working conditions. This reset would require the construction of new foundations for economic and social systems.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p5.1">The WEF Global Risks Report 2022 focuses on five main categories, which are also part of their “Great Narrative for Humankind” initiative:</p><ul id="Ch4.S7.I3">
<li id="Ch4.S7.I3.i1">

</li>
<li id="Ch4.S7.I3.i5">
<span>•</span>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p5.2">The report emphasizes that the erosion of social cohesion has been a significant global issue since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. In addressing these challenges, the WEF suggests that public-private collaborations are necessary to ensure effective decision-making and to safeguard the future of humanity.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p6">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p6.1">The report also highlights the increasing digital dependency that intensifies cyberthreats, as the WEF has long warned of the potential for a significant cyber pandemic. The rapid spread of a cyber attack with “COVID-like characteristics” could potentially cause more damage than any biological virus.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p7">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p7.1">The WEF Global Risks Report 2022 delves further into the potential consequences of a cyber pandemic. In a section titled “Shocks to Reflect Upon” the report explores the possibility of a wide-ranging and costly attack that could lead to cascading failures in systemically important businesses and disrupt services, ultimately undermining digital transformation efforts made in recent year.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p8">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p8.1">The report also emphasizes the need for governments to address cyberthreats and warns that without mitigation, the escalation of cyberwarfare and the disruption of societies could result in a loss of trust in governments’ ability to act as digital stewards.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p9">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p9.1">To better understand the risks associated with technology, the WEF report explores the concept of the fourth industrial revolution, which Schwab believes will lead to the fusion of our physical, biological, and digital identities. This fusion will be facilitated by technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of things-enabled devices, edge computing, blockchain, and 5G. You can see they’re examining similar things to this book.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p10">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p10.1">As explaining in this work, these technologies present numerous opportunities for businesses and societies, they also expose users to elevated and more pernicious forms of digital and cyber risk. The report also discusses the potential emergence of the metaverse, which could create new vulnerabilities for malicious actors by increasing the number of entry points for malware and data breaches, again a central theme of this text.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p11">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p11.1">In light of these risks, the WEF report suggests that users will need to navigate security vulnerabilities inherent in complex technologies characterized by decentralization and a lack of structured guardrails or sophisticated onboarding infrastructure.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p12">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p12.1">The report also touches on the issue of digital identity as we do. They view digital identity is a crucial component of accessing products, services, and information in a digital world, but again, this raises concerns about privacy, security, and the potential for misuse.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p13">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p13.1">Finally, the WEF Global Risks Report 2022 addresses the issue of public trust, noting that the growth of deepfakes and disinformation-for-hire can deepen mistrust between societies, businesses, and governments. We can already see this starting to happen as Musk’s defence lawyers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/27/elon-musks-statements-could-be-deepfakes-tesla-defence-lawyers-tell-court" title="">point to possible deepfake use</a> around video comments he is alleged to have made with regard to Tesla’s software safety. To rebuild trust and social cohesion, the report calls for leaders to adopt new models, look long term, renew cooperation, and act systemically. Quite what they think they can do in the face of images like the recent memes of the Pope is unclear <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch9.F1" title="Figure 9.1 ‣ 9.1.6 The World Economic Forum ‣ 9.1 Global politics &amp; digital society ‣ Chapter 9 Affecting global change ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>9.1</span></a> .</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p14">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS6.p14.1">It’s absolutely crucial to note that the WEF is a powerful organisation, with global sway over policy, and is an enormous concentration of power in the hands of unelected technocrats. The authors are very sceptical of the WEF, but this report highlights what both technocrats and policy makers are thinking.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>4.7.7 </span>Money and The State</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p1.1">It seems a pretty reasonable that the best ‘systemic’ approach is a separation between major centralising forces such as state, church, and money. In practice we can see that globally, this isn’t the case, with bad hotspots of high corruption where all three meld together into kleptocratic dictatorships, or theocracies. For our purposes in the UK it’s useful to look at the concept of ‘austerity’.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p2.1">Austerity is a term used to describe a set of economic policies that aim to reduce government spending and debt, often through cuts to public services and welfare programs. The concept of austerity has its origins in the 1920s, following the end of World War I and the economic crisis that ensued. In the wake of the war, many Western European countries were struggling with high levels of debt and inflation. In response, governments began implementing policies to reduce spending and balance their budgets.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p3.1">We have seen in the previous chapter that the concept of inflation itself is complex, and somewhat argued about still. Globally, on aggregate, the efficiencies of increasing technology are thought to be deflationary to the tune of between 3 and 5 percent annually, though this may radically spike up in the era of AI which will be covered later. This is counter to the current need for inflation to maintain debt repayments at a national level. Central banks manipulate interest rates to control inflation, aiming to keep it at sustainable levels. This process is necessary because as national debt and deficits grow, governments need inflation to prevent these debts from spiraling out of control. Higher inflation results in higher nominal GDP, which in turn increases the tax base, providing governments with the revenue needed to pay down debt. To achieve this. The natural progression of humanity inherently deflationary, which forces central banks to print more money and further manipulate the monetary system in order to generate the desired inflation. This can be seen as a hidden tax on citizens, as it devalues their money over time. The negative effects of this system are disproportionately felt by lower-income groups. As inflation rises, the cost of living increases, and many households struggle to make ends meet. This has led to a situation where households need multiple incomes to maintain their standard of living, forcing individuals to work longer hours and take on multiple jobs. As a result, people have less free time and energy to engage in rewarding activities or spend time with their families. This need for constant economic growth, as measured by GDP, has led to an environment where individuals are pushed to be more productive at the expense of their well-being. This has resulted in a society where many people are overworked and struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living. Booth discussed this at length in his book ‘The Price of Tomorrow’. His is a rare thesis based around the ideas that technology is deflationary, that the marginal cost of goods trends over zero over time, and that the current system of debt and inflation are inherently unsustainable in the face of exponential technology improvements and automation. We discuss the concept of inflation and deflation, and both their risks throughout the book, but Booth has been very clear on this for many years. He thinks the current global monetary system ill-suited to handle the challenges and opportunities presented by deflation. He suggests that embracing deflation is the key to unlocking a prosperous and sustainable future. The book delves into the implications of deflation on various aspects of society, including wealth distribution, job markets, and the role of governments in shaping economic policies. <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx138" title="">138</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p4.1">In the 1920s, Keynes was one of the first to argue against the austerity measures which seem part of the cyclical playbook around debt and inflation. He argued that that cutting government spending during a recession would only worsen the economic downturn. Instead, he advocated for increased government spending to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment. Despite this, many governments continued to implement austerity policies throughout the 1920s and 1930s.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p5.1">In the post-World War II period, the rise of the welfare state and the adoption of Keynesian economic policies led to a shift away from austerity in many countries. However, in the 1970s, a new economic crisis led to a resurgence of austerity policies, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom. In the 1980s, the rise of neoliberalism and the influence of economists such as Milton Friedman led to further cuts to government spending and the rolling back of the welfare state.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p6">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p6.1">Today, the concept of austerity continues to shape economic policy, particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Many governments, particularly in Europe, have implemented austerity measures in response to the crisis, leading to cuts to public services and welfare programs. The effectiveness of these policies remains a contentious issue, with some arguing that they have helped to reduce debt and stabilize economies, while others argue that they have led to increased inequality and hindered economic growth. Looking around at the state of the world, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor, it is possible to have some sympathy with those who see patterns in the bahaviour of political leaders and the controllers of Western capital and global resources. The system seems engineered to reward a few. It is possible to view ‘austerity’ as a means of political control of economic levers, in order to de-democratise populations. This mantra of ‘do more, consume less’ has perhaps become a defacto methodology to constrain popular ideas, diverting capital back into the hands of incumbents, land owners, and the politically and economically motivated <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx139" title="">139</a>]</cite>. It seems that the controlling nexus of this political framework globally is the concept of the central bank, unelected technocrats whose tenures span across political administrations. Again, this can be traced back to the 1920’s. Hawtrey’s 1925 “Currency &amp; Public Administration” asserts that a central bank should <span id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p6.1.1">“Never explain; never regret; never apologise.”</span>, and speaks glowingly of the selfish market <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx140" title="">140</a>]</cite>. This economic model is referred to as Dirigisme and feels increasingly the global norm <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx141" title="">141</a>]</cite>. We can perhaps here see the divergent point at which the lionization of the market began. Again, to be clear, the authors are not economists, but it does seem that in a global digital society there is room to explore more equitable models of global value, governance, and trust.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p7">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p7.1">Remember that these centrally planned national and global actions provide liquidity to the private banking sector. Like the digital money analogues discussed earlier in the book private banks operate fractional reserve banking. This is a banking system where banks hold only a fraction of the deposits they receive as reserves, while the rest is lent out to customers. This means that the money supply in an economy can be increased through the lending activities of banks (itself a complex inflationary force which devalues money over time, feeding back into the policy directives of the central banks. The fractional reserve system is useful for capital creation in times of growth, but relies on the confidence of the depositors.

He says those that formed the initial lines carried memories of the great depression, but that once youtube started showing the footage more broadly the contagion struck. In the world of instant messaging media today we can perhaps see how this might happen again. More recently, the 2023 ‘wobble’ in global banking caused by the collapse of America’s 5th largest <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-svb-and-signature-bank-failed-so-fast-and-the-us-banking-crisis-isnt-over-yet-201737" title="">bank SVB</a> has precipitated strong intervention by the federal government, who have opted to ‘backstop’ investor deposits.

<p id="Ch4.S7.SS7.p10.1">There is a growing awareness of the role of banks in the economy, and a growing desire for greater transparency and accountability.

<h5>
<span>4.7.8 </span>Surveillance Capitalism</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p1.1">Surveillance capitalism is a term coined by Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff to describe the business model of using data collected from individuals to target advertising and influence behavior. The concept of surveillance capitalism emerged in the late 20th and early 21st centuries with the rise of technology companies that specialize in gathering and analyzing personal data.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p2.1">The history of surveillance capitalism can be traced back to the early days of the internet. In the 1990s, companies such as DoubleClick and Omniture began collecting data on internet users’ browsing habits in order to target advertising. As the internet grew in popularity, these companies were able to gather an increasing amount of data on individuals, allowing them to more effectively target advertising and increase profits.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p3.1">The advent of smart phones and mobile technology in the 2000s further expanded the reach of surveillance capitalism. With the widespread adoption of smart phones and mobile apps, companies were able to collect even more data on individuals, including location data and information about their physical activity. This data was used to target advertising and influence behavior, leading to the rise of companies such as Google and Facebook, which have become dominant players in the digital advertising market.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p4.1">The use of data collected from individuals to influence behaviour has also been used to influence political campaigns. In the 2016 US presidential election, Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm, used data collected from Facebook users to influence voter behaviour. The firm used the data to target advertising and create psychological profiles of individuals, allowing them to more effectively influence voter behaviour.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p5.1">The business model of surveillance capitalism has been widely criticized for its ethical implications. Critics argue that the collection and use of personal data without consent is a violation of individuals’ privacy and that the use of data to influence behaviour is manipulative and unethical. In recent years, there have been calls for greater regulation of the tech industry to address these concerns.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p6">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p6.1">Surveillance capitalism has led to significant compliance overheads for companies that collect and use personal data. There are a number of laws and regulations that have been put in place to protect individuals’ privacy, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in California, USA. These laws require companies to obtain consent from individuals before collecting and using their data, and to provide individuals with the right to access, correct, and delete their data.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p7">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p7.1">Complying with these laws can be costly and time-consuming for companies. They may need to hire additional staff to handle data privacy compliance, and may also need to invest in new technology to manage and protect personal data. In addition, companies are at risk of significant fines if they fail to comply with these laws.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p8">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p8.1">In terms of who profits from surveillance capitalism, the primary beneficiaries are technology companies such as Google and Facebook, which have become dominant players in the digital advertising market. These companies collect and analyse large amounts of personal data, which they use to target advertising and influence behavior. This allows them to generate significant profits from advertising revenue.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p9">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p9.1">On the other hand, those who suffer the most negative impact from surveillance capitalism are individuals, whose personal data is collected and used without their consent. They are also at risk of their privacy being violated, and their personal data being misused. Additionally, the collection and use of personal data can lead to the manipulation of individuals’ behaviour and decision-making, which can have negative consequences for their lives and society at large.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p10">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p10.1">Moreover, the business model of surveillance capitalism has also been criticized for creating a power imbalance between companies and individuals. Companies have access to vast amounts of personal data, which they can use to influence behavior and make decisions that affect individuals’ lives. This can lead to a lack of privacy and autonomy for individuals, and can also lead to discrimination and bias in decision-making.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p11">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p11.1">This is collectively an erosion of the demarcation between data, state surveillance, banking, and political leadership globally.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p12">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p12.1">The term "surveillance state" refers to a state in which government agencies have the power to collect and analyze large amounts of personal data, often without the consent of individuals. The rise of surveillance capitalism has led to concerns about the potential for the creation of a surveillance state, as government agencies may use the data collected by companies for surveillance purposes.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p13">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p13.1">There have been instances where government agencies have used data collected by companies for surveillance purposes. For example, in the United States, the National Security Agency (NSA) has been accused of using data collected by companies such as Google and Facebook for surveillance purposes. The agency’s PRISM program, which was revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013, was designed to collect and analyze data from internet companies in order to identify and track individuals. Europe is <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/" title="">clear about it’s intentions</a> to mandate their complete access to all encrypted personal communications in forthcoming legislation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p14">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p14.1">The use of data collected by companies for surveillance purposes can have significant implications for individuals’ privacy and civil liberties. It can also lead to a lack of transparency and accountability, as government agencies may use the data without the knowledge or consent of individuals. In addition, the use of data for surveillance purposes can lead to discrimination and bias in decision-making, as well as a chilling effect on free speech and the exercise of other rights.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p15">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p15.1">Akten has been <a href="https://memoakten.medium.com/all-watched-over-by-machines-of-loving-grace-8c2464aa6fda" title="">talking about</a> the phase transition from digital surveillance to pernicious corporate AI in terms of a modern ‘religion’ for many years <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx142" title="">142</a>]</cite>. He feels that despite public awareness of privacy invasion, there has been no significant outcry or unanimous demand for privacy. Instead, most individuals seem to find comfort in the belief that a higher force is watching and protecting the virtuous, while punishing wrongdoers. The concept of a ‘digital deity’ emerge from his thinking in this context, reflecting the role that religion and traditional gods have played in providing ethical frameworks, security, discipline, power, and other societal functions. More recently O’Gieblyn has been drawing the same conclusions <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx143" title="">143</a>]</cite>, explicitly linking religiosity to the imperative to ‘create a godhead’ simply because it can be done, not pausing to discuss if it should be. Rosenberg calls this ‘a threat to Epistemic Agency’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx144" title="">144</a>]</cite>More recently the Harari, author of Sapiens <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx145" title="">145</a>]</cite> <a href="https://forumlive.frontiersin.org/agenda/speakers/2977577" title="">said of AI</a>: <span id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p15.1.1">“For thousands of years, prophets and poets and politicians have used language and storytelling in order to manipulate and to control people and to reshape society. Now AI is likely to be able to do it. And once it can… it doesn’t need to send killer robots to shoot us. It can get humans to pull the trigger. We need to act quickly before AI gets out of our control. Drug companies cannot sell people new medicines without first subjecting these products to rigorous safety checks.”</span> (AI will be discussed in detail in a later chapter).</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p16">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p16.1">Klein at the New York Times has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/opinion/chatbots-artificial-intelligence-future-weirdness.html" title="">writing against this point</a> for some time. His well articulated fear, is that the current model where three major Western companies, with similar highly competitive capitalist origins and values, should certainly not be in charge of racing to monetise the most compelling and innately unknowable chat bot experience. As societies shift towards materialism and technological dependence, traditional gods lose their relevance, and the need for a new form of overseer arises. This digital deity, existing within the realm of technology and the cloud, perhaps represents an adaptation of primal human belief systems. This will be explored further in the AI/ML chapter later.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p17">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p17.1">In conclusion, the rise of surveillance capitalism has led to concerns about the potential for the creation of a surveillance state, or worse, a new kind of omnipresent digital culturla authority. Corporations and government agencies may use the data collected by companies for surveillance purposes. This can have significant implications for individuals’ privacy and civil liberties. It’s important for laws and regulations to be in place to safeguard citizens’ rights and privacy in regards to the use of data by government agencies, and to hold them accountable for any misuse of data, and yet it seems the reality of the situation in ‘post Snowden’ seems far from that.</p></div>

<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p20">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p20.1">The adoption of printing by Europeans in the 15th century led to concerns around access to printed material. The right to read and the right to publish were central subjects in the struggle for freedom of thought for most of the last half millennium. The basic concern was for the right to read in private and to think, speak, and act based on a free and uncensored will. The primary antagonist for freedom of thought at the beginning of this struggle was the universal Catholic Church, an institution aimed at controlling thought in the European world through weekly surveillance of individuals, censorship of all reading material, and the ability to predict and punish unorthodox thought. In early modern Europe, the tools available for thought control were limited, but they were effective. For hundreds of years, the struggle centered around the book as a mass-manufactured article in Western culture, and whether individuals could print, possess, traffic, read, or teach from books without the permission or control of an entity empowered to punish thought. By the end of the 17th century, censorship of written material in Europe began to break down in waves throughout the European world, and the book became an article of subversive commerce, undermining the control of thought.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p21.1">Currently, a new phase in human history is beginning as we are building a single extraneous digital nervous system, that will connect every human mind. Within two generations, every single human being will be connected to this network, in which all thoughts, plans, dreams, and actions will flow as nervous impulses. The fate of freedom of thought and human freedom as a whole will depend upon the organization of this network. Our current generation is the last in which human brains will be formed without contact with this network, and from now on, every human brain will be formed from early life in direct connection to the network, with input from generative AI/ML systems. This possibly results in humanity becoming a super organism of a sort, where each of us is but a neuron in the brain. Unfortunately, this generation has been raised to be consumers of media, which is now consuming us.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p22">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p22.1">Anonymous reading is being determined against. Efforts discussed throughout the book to ensure privacy, from Zimmerman and the cypherpunks onward, have been met with resistance from government efforts to monitor and control information flow. The outcome of the organization of this network, and the freedom it allows, is currently being decided by this generation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p23">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p23.1">It is not solely the ease of surveillance, nor solely the permanence of data, that is concerning, it is the relentless nature of living after the “end of forgetting”. Today’s encrypted traffic, which is used with relative security, will eventually be decrypted as more data becomes available for crypto analysis. This means that security protocols will need to be constantly updated and redone. Furthermore, no information is ever truly lost, and every piece of information can be retained and eventually linked to other information. This is the rationale behind government officials who argue that a robust social graph of the United States is needed. The primary form of data collection that should be of most concern is media that is used to spy on us, such as books that watch us read them and search boxes that report our searches to unknown parties. There is a lot of discussion about data coming out of Meta/Facebook, but the true threat is code going in. For the past 15 years, enterprise computing has been adding a layer of analytics on top of data warehouses, which is known as business intelligence. This allows for the vast amount of data in a company’s possession to be analyzed and used to answer questions the company did not know it had. The real threat of Facebook is the business intelligence layer on top of the Facebook data warehouse, which contains the behaviour of nearly a billion people. Intelligence agencies from around the world want to access this layer in order to find specific classes of people, such as potential agents, sources, and individuals that can be influenced or tortured. The goal is to run code within Facebook to extract this information, instead of obtaining data from Facebook, which would be dead data once extracted. Facebook wants to be a media company and control the web, but the reality is the true value of Facebook is the information and behavior of it’s users, and the ability to mine that data.
Distributed internet protocols are important in the context of government overreach into digital society and people’s private lives because they provide a level of decentralization and resilience that can help protect against censorship and surveillance.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p24">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p24.1">For example, if a government were to attempt to censor or block access to a centralized internet service, it could potentially do so with relative ease. However, if that same service were distributed across a network of nodes, it would be much more difficult for the government to effectively censor or block access to it.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p25">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p25.1">Another advantage of distributed protocols is that they are typically more resilient to attacks or failures. If one node in the network goes offline or is compromised, the others can continue to operate, ensuring that the service remains available. This can be especially important in situations where the internet is being used for critical communication, such as during a natural disaster or political crisis.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p26">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p26.1">In addition to their benefits for censorship resistance and resilience, distributed protocols can also help protect people’s privacy. Because they do not rely on centralized servers or infrastructure, they can be more difficult for governments or other entities to monitor or track. This can be especially important in countries where government surveillance is prevalent or where individuals may be at risk of persecution for their online activities.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p27">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p27.1">There are a number of distributed protocols that have been developed specifically to address issues of censorship and privacy, and these will be covered in more detail later.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p28">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p28.1">It is important to note that distributed protocols are not a silver bullet for censorship or privacy concerns. They can be vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as those that target the nodes of the network, and they may not always be practical for certain types of applications. However, they do provide an important tool for those seeking to protect their freedom of expression and privacy online. They offer a valuable tool for those seeking to protect their freedom of expression and privacy online, and they will likely continue to play a critical role in the future of the internet.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p29">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p29.1">In recent years, several countries have proposed or passed bills that would result in unprecedented levels of online censorship. One such example is Canada’s Bill C-11, also known as the Online Streaming Act. This bill was first proposed in November 2020 as Bill C-10, but failed to pass due to its controversial provisions. It was reintroduced in February 2021 as Bill C-11 and was approved by the Canadian House of Commons, the first step in the process of becoming law. If passed, the bill would give the Canadian Radio, Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) the power to decide what content Canadians can view on YouTube and other social media platforms. The CRTC would also have the power to dictate what content creators can produce, with a focus on promoting "Canadian content." Additionally, the bill would require certain broadcasters to contribute to the Canada Media Fund, which is used to fund mainstream media in Canada. The bill is currently being considered by the Canadian Senate, which will vote on it in February. If passed, it will then be debated by the Canadian Parliament. Tech companies such as YouTube have reportedly failed to convince the Senate to exclude user-generated content from the bill, indicating a high likelihood of it becoming law. The potential impact on the internet and free expression in Canada is significant, as the bill would give the government significant control over online content and restrict the ability of individuals to share their views and perspectives.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p31.1">The European Union (EU) has separated its online censorship efforts into two separate bills: the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act. These bills were introduced in December 2020 and are part of the EU’s Digital Services package, which aims to be completed by 2030. The Digital Services package is the second phase of the EU’s digital agenda, which is being enforced through regulation in the public sector and through ESG investing in the private sector. Both the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act were passed in spring 2022 and went into force in autumn 2022, but will not be enforced until later this year and early next year, depending on the size of the relevant entity. The Digital Markets Act aims to increase the EU’s competitiveness in the tech space by imposing massive fines on "gatekeepers," or companies that maintain monopolies by giving preference to their own products and services. This could open the door to innovation in cryptocurrency in the EU, but also requires gatekeepers to provide detailed data about the individuals and institutions using their products and services to the EU. The Digital Services Act, on the other hand, aims to regulate the content that is available online, including user-generated content. It does this by requiring companies to remove illegal content within one hour of it being reported and by imposing fines for non-compliance. The act also requires companies to implement measures to protect users from illegal content and from "other forms of harm," which is defined broadly and could include a wide range of content. The EU is also in the process of passing the Artificial Intelligence Regulation Act, which will be discussed later this year and is reportedly the first of its kind. All five bills in the EU’s Digital Services package are regulations, meaning they will override the national laws of EU countries. The potential impact on the internet and free expression in the EU is significant, as the Digital Services Act would give the government significant control over online content and restrict the ability of individuals to share their views and perspectives.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p32.1">In the United States, two significant documents related to online censorship are the Kids Online Safety Act and the Supreme Court case Gonzalez v. Google. The Kids Online Safety Act was introduced in February 2021 and is expected to pass later this year due to bipartisan support. The act requires online services to collect Know Your Customer (KYC) information to ensure that they are not showing harmful content to minors. It also gives the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the power to decide when children have been made unsafe online and allows parents to sue tech companies if their children have been harmed online. The act has received criticism from both sides of the political spectrum and entities outside of Congress, as it is seen as giving too much power to the government to regulate online content and could lead to increased censorship by tech companies.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p33">
<p id="Ch4.S7.SS8.p33.1">The Supreme Court case Gonzalez v. Google involves the question of whether Google’s algorithmic recommendations supported terrorism and contributed to the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. The case has been picked up by the Supreme Court after being passed up by various courts of appeal. It is being heard alongside another case, Twitter v. Tumne, involving the role of Twitter’s algorithms in a terrorist attack in Istanbul. There are two potential outcomes for the case. If the Supreme Court sides with Gonzalez, it could increase the liability of social media companies under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which allows them to moderate content to a limited extent without violating the First Amendment. Alternatively, the Supreme Court could declare Section 230 unconstitutional, which would make online censorship illegal but also hinder the use of algorithms on the internet. The ideal outcome, in theory, would be for the Supreme Court to side with Google and for Congress to change Section 230. However, giving Congress the power to change the law could lead to increased censorship and the potential for abuse of power.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>4.8 </span>Government over-reach through bureaucracy</h4>
<div id="Ch4.S8.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S8.p1.1">As an contextual example of the soft power which political apparatus uses to influence emergent human behaviour and their markets it is useful to look again to the USA. In 2013, the Obama Administration, faced with a divided Congress, resorted to using the banking system as a means to implement policy through non-traditional channels. This effort, known as Operation Choke Point, was a continuation of their success in cutting off the offshore online poker industry from banking services. Initially, the crackdown was aimed at the payday lending industry, but it soon expanded to include gun sales and adult entertainment, and eventually up to 30 different industries.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S8.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S8.p2.1">The rationale behind Operation Choke Point was to target banks that facilitated fraud, as indicated by a high ratio of fraud and disputes. However, the operation soon evolved into a redlining of industries based on nothing more than the perceived risk of reputational harm. Financial institutions were investigated without any evidence of losses. Throughout the entire operation, there was no new legislation or written guidance issued. Banks were simply warned of increased regulatory scrutiny if they did not comply.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S8.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S8.p3.1">Major banks continue to deny services to industries such as firearms and fossil fuels, and they continue to assign higher risk ratings to industries that may face government criticism, even in the absence of any official guidance. This utilisation of the financial system as a means of driving change is seen by some as a legitimate, if not ideal, mechanism; as just one more type of market actor. Regardless of one’s political perspective, it is important to consider the moral hazard of bypassing traditional political channels and using bureaucratic mechanisms as a means of affecting change in the free market. It is important to consider how the power of these tactics might be used in the future by opposing political groups. For example, supporters of Operation Choke Point who were in favour of increased financial pressure on the oil and gas industry may not feel the same if the same techniques were applied to organizations like Planned Parenthood. From this perspective, the tactics used by Operation Choke Point can be seen as undemocratic, regardless of who is deploying them. Bringing this back to our study of new financial tooling in crypto we can look to recent events:</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S8.p4.1">It seems that in the absence of democratic the SEC is attempting to use their tools to control and centralise the ‘ramps’ into and out of digital assets, and the rules around holding them for investors. The SEC has proposed a new rule that would require registered investment advisors to use qualified custodians for all assets, including cryptocurrencies. The intention behind this proposal is to improve investor protection by mandating that custodians hold customer assets in segregated and identifiable accounts. However, critics argue that this proposal would limit the number of qualified cryptocustodians and deter investment advisors from advising their clients on crypto. The few banks with the necessary technical capabilities and regulatory approvals will have a monopoly on crypto custodial services, while exchanges without a banking license or trust bank will likely lose out. The proposal assumes that crypto assets are securities without going through a process to determine that. The outcome of the proposal will depend on the stringency of the SEC’s qualified custodian registrations. The proposal is currently in a 60-day public comment period before the Commissioners hold another vote on whether to pass the rule.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S8.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S8.p5.1">Caitlyn Long explains that the proposed rule would not necessarily kill crypto custody, but would be a move against State Charter trust companies. She points out the big issue with the proposal, which is the requirement for custodians to indemnify for negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct. This would apply to all asset classes, including commodities and crypto, which could kill the custody business broadly. The SEC proposal would apply the custody rule to all asset classes, including commodities and crypto, which is okay, but the SEC also wants custodians to indemnify the full asset value for losses in which the custodian played any role, even for physical assets like oil, cattle, and wheat. This would upset long-standing insurance terms and could cause huge pushback from the banking, Wall Street, commodities, and crypto industries. Sarah Brennan believes that the proposal represents continued governmental efforts at denial of service attacks on crypto, and that the SEC’s approach only seeks to chill digital asset markets. She and the Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee are urging stakeholders to submit public comments on the proposed amendments to ensure the custody rule for investment advisors is modernized appropriately. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service plans to hire nearly 30k new staff and technology over the next two years, spending $80 billion to improve tax enforcement, much of it focussing on crypto markets. It might be that the industry follows the prevailing winds <a href="https://noelleacheson.substack.com/p/weekly-feb-25-2023" title="">and pivots to the East</a>.

<h4>
<span>4.9 </span>Global monetary policy</h4>
<div id="Ch4.S9.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S9.p1.1">The term “don’t fight the Fed” has been used in trading circles for many years. Owing to the pre-eminent role of the dollar in global markets actions of the political and central banking bodies which impact the dollar always have global reach. It is worth knowing that these decisions are usually contested, and worse, the power of the decision makers seems rooted in their narrative impact. It’s a pretty terrible system given the impact on billions of lives. The Federal Reserve System, which is comprised of a Board of Governors, 12 regional banks, and an Open Market Committee, is a privately-owned central banking system in the United States. The member banks of each Federal Reserve Bank vote on the majority of the Reserve Bank’s directors and the directors vote on members to serve on the Open Market Committee, which determines monetary policy. The president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank is traditionally given the vice chairmanship of the Open Market Committee and is a permanent committee member. This means that private banks are the key determinants in the composition of the Open Market Committee, which regulates the entire economy. The Federal Reserve is an independent agency and its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government. The Fed’s profits are returned to the Treasury each year, but the member banks’ shares of the Fed earn them a 6% dividend. The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bailouts exposed the fundamental conflicts of interest at the heart of the Federal Reserve System, where the very banks that caused the crisis were the recipients of the trillions of dollars in bailout money. These conflicts of interest were baked into the Federal Reserve Act over 100 years ago and are a structural feature of the institution. The concentration of power within this group is staggering.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>4.10.1 </span>Gridless</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S10.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S10.SS1.p1.1">In the course of researching this book we see most opportunity for change in Africa. As an example the company ‘Gridless’ began by examining different energy sources in Africa and exploring opportunities for larger energy generation and grid-connected energy. However, they found that the real benefit of gridless energy was in providing energy to places that were not well connected and did not have a good grid. They contacted mini-grid providers all over East and Southern Africa to learn about their problems. A mini-grid is defined as a project that generates energy under 2 megawatts, often under 1 megawatt. They discovered that these providers had to overbuild for the community, resulting in stranded energy. The company found a way to utilize this stranded energy by placing Bitcoin miners on it and paying the mini-grid providers for it. They tested this method and found it to be successful. Additionally, they implemented a system to automate and remotely turn off the power during periods of high usage to make the grid more efficient and sustainable. This solution provided a win-win-win situation for the company, the mini-grid providers, and the communities they served.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S10.SS1.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S10.SS1.p2.1">The company utilizes Bitcoin miners to create space for other activities and to increase access to affordable energy for communities and small businesses. As energy usage increases in the community, the company decreases their usage of miners and moves them to other locations. This is outlined in their contracts with partners. The company is currently testing this method and has encountered some challenges, such as losing internet connection at one of their sites and poor rainfall affecting the amount of water flowing into turbines. They have found that building a lean operation with flexible and adaptable staff is crucial, as well as creating processes and systems to manage variables. The company also faces unique environmental factors such as lightning strikes, which require them to turn off their operations temporarily.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S10.SS1.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S10.SS1.p3.1">Gridless suggest that those who are critical of opportunities like this often come from a place of privilege and do not understand the consequences of their actions in places like Africa where access to electricity and other resources is limited. They argue that these critics, who are often from the West, have blinders on and cannot see the impact of their actions on a global scale. They suggest that more people need to travel and have diverse experiences in order to change their perspective on Bitcoin and its potential to support human flourishing in underprivileged areas. They also mention that gridless plans may become a case study for the positive impact of Bitcoin mining on economic opportunities, particularly in rural Africa.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S11.p2.1">President Bukele, who has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, stated that the adoption of Bitcoin was a way to promote financial inclusion and stability in the country, where more than 70% of the population is unbanked or underbanked. In a tweet, he stated, “Bitcoin will have the same value as the US dollar. We will support both. They will have the same power of purchase and will be accepted in the same way.”</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p3">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p3.1">The move was met with a lot of media attention and reaction, with some praising it as a bold and innovative step, while others raised concerns about the volatility of Bitcoin and their potential impact on the economy. President Nayib Bukele himself has faced criticism for his handling of political power and some of his actions have raised concerns about the potential for abuses of power. In 2021, President Bukele faced widespread criticism for his handling of the legislative process and his use of the military to secure the Legislative Assembly building during a political standoff with lawmakers. This led to allegations of intimidation and a violation of democratic norms, and raised concerns about his willingness to use force to achieve his political goals. Additionally, President Bukele has faced criticism for his use of social media to communicate with the public and his tendency to bypass traditional media outlets, which has raised concerns about the potential for censorship and the manipulation of information. With that said he seems much loved in the country, and the previously appalling safety statistics of the nation have radically improved.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p4.1">In addition to the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador has also proposed the issuance of a Bitcoin-backed bond to finance various public works projects and promote the use of Bitcoin. The bond would be denominated in Bitcoin and would allow investors to directly participate in the country’s development while also supporting the growth and adoption of Bitcoin.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p5.1">Another ambitious project that has been proposed by President Bukele and his administration is the creation of “Bitcoin City”, a new city that would mine Bitcoin at the base of a dormant Volcano, and offer considerable tax benefits to holders. The city would serve as a hub for innovation and a showcase for the potential of Bitcoin, and would offer a wide range of services, including housing, healthcare, education, and entertainment.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p6">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p6.1">There has been a significant increase in the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador, and apparently increased inward investment to the country. Many businesses, both small and large, have started accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, and there has been a growing interest in Bitcoin among the general population. Additionally, the government has been actively promoting the use of Bitcoin through various initiatives. There have also been efforts to educate the public about Bitcoin and its potential benefits, including increased financial security and reduced transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p7">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p7.1">Overall, the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador has been positive, far outstripping the number of people in the country with traditional bank accounts, and has the potential to greatly impact the country’s economy and financial sector. However, it is important to note that there are still challenges to overcome, such as regulatory and infrastructure limitations, as well as ongoing concerns about the volatility and stability of Bitcoin.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p8">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p8.1">Somewhat surprisingly the IMF have de-escalated their previously highly critical assessment of the move, toward a more <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/10/el-salvador-staff-concluding-statement-of-the-2023-article-iv-mission" title="">concerned and conciliatory tone</a>:
<span id="Ch4.S11.p8.1.1">“Bitcoin’s risks should be addressed. While risks have not materialized due to the limited Bitcoin use so far—as suggested by survey and remittances data—its use could grow given its legal tender status and new legislative reforms to encourage the use of crypto assets, including tokenized bonds (Digital Assets Law). In this context, underlying risks to financial integrity and stability, fiscal sustainability, and consumer protection persist, and the recommendations of the 2021 Article IV remain valid. Greater transparency over the government’s transactions in Bitcoin and the financial situation of the state-owned Bitcoin-wallet (Chivo) remains essential, especially to assess the underlying fiscal contingencies and counterparty risks.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p9">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p9.1">In terms of economic impact, it is still too early to determine the full effects of the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador. However, it is expected to have a positive impact on financial inclusion and stability, as well as reducing the reliance on traditional banking systems. The use of Bitcoin has the potential to lower transaction fees and increase financial security, which could be particularly beneficial for those who do not have access to traditional banking services.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p10">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p10.1">Overall, the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador marks a significant step forward in the mainstream acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin and has the potential to set a precedent for other countries to follow. However, it is important to monitor the situation and assess the long-term impacts on the economy and financial sector.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p11">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p11.1">The swift rise of digital walled gardens, moving towards a less transparent internet, reveals both a need for user data protection and a corporate push for greater control and profit. Tech giants like Google, Reddit, and Twitter are increasingly controlling their platforms, adjusting data flows for revenue growth. Google’s new privacy policy, which allows data collection for AI model training, increases public concerns over user consent and privacy rights. The wide-ranging language of the policy gives Google considerable power in using user-generated content, fueling debates on data usage ethics. Simultaneously, the social web’s shift towards an entertainment-focused business model prioritizes revenue over human connection. Platforms target ad revenue through vertically scrolling videos, risking reduced content diversity and creating echo chambers.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p12">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p12.1">Entertainment unions like the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) are grappling with AI’s impact on employment. Their approach includes research, collaboration, education, political advocacy, organizing, and collective bargaining to protect members’ interests, including upskilling initiatives. Upskilling is gaining industry attention. Companies like Tata Consultancy highlight the need to equip engineers with AI skills. Recognizing AI technologies’ potential, they invest in reskilling programs to stay competitive and effectively use AI tools.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p13">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p13.1">The rise of generative AI and the declining open web raises concerns about maintaining digital commons and encouraging diverse perspectives. AI-generated content could overshadow human contributions, making meaningful information harder to find and increasing misinformation risks. This situation highlights the need for balance between AI-generated and human-generated content.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p14">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p14.1">Data control battles between platforms and users fuel debates on data ownership and profit sharing. Users demand more control over their data use and potentially a share in the resulting profits. This issue emphasizes the need for transparent data policies and fair user compensation models.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p15">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p15.1">The influence of AI on the job market and the future of work is a significant concern. As AI technology progresses, the need for upskilling and reskilling programs grows to ensure workers can adapt to changing job requirements. Collaboration between industries, governments, and educational institutions is essential to address AI-induced disruptions and ensure a smooth workforce transition.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S11.p16">
<p id="Ch4.S11.p16.1">Finally, the importance of AI ethics and governance grows as AI technologies become more prevalent. The development and deployment of AI systems require ethical frameworks, transparency, and accountability. Collaboration between AI researchers, policymakers, and ethicists is critical to address potential risks and societal implications of AI technology.</p></div>

<div id="Ch4.S12.SS2.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS2.p1.1">In an opinion piece for The Hill by Bill Drexel and Caleb Withers, titled "Generative AI could be an authoritarian breakthrough in brainwashing," the authors argue that the concern isn’t just external attempts to influence U.S. elections, but the impact on the populations within authoritarian countries. They posit that foreign disinformation efforts by Chinese and Russian entities are only the tip of the iceberg, with Beijing and Moscow disseminating massive amounts of propaganda to their own populations. The authors also cite instances of AI-enabled propaganda and misinformation campaigns, both in the context of undermining democracies and consolidating control within authoritarian states.</p></div>

<div id="Ch4.S12.SS3.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS3.p1.1">Another critical concern around AI and authoritarianism is the potential for increased surveillance. With the integration of AI and data scraping techniques, governments can employ extensive teams to facilitate unprecedented levels of surveillance, compromising privacy. Such concerns are raised in the works of authors like Daniel Oberhaus, who posits that authoritarian regimes may have an advantage in AI due to their willingness to exploit data, such as advanced facial recognition data, in ways that open societies might not.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S12.SS4.p1.1">Furthermore, the issue of worker surveillance, especially with the rise of remote work regimes, has garnered the attention of various entities, including the White House. This is due to concerns over automated systems that employers are using to monitor their remote workers, highlighting a less benign context of surveillance.</p></div>

<div id="Ch4.S12.SS5.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS5.p1.1">One way AI might foster authoritarianism is by supporting the ideology of closed societies or authoritarian regimes, such as China. These societies may leverage their global influence to disseminate their particular AI model, aligning it with their motivations and goals. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace points out that for most countries, AI technology is viewed as an economic development factor that determines their standing in the global technology race, rather than as an ideological preference.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S12.SS6.p1.1">Another concern is the fear that AI will make centrally planned economies seem viable, where past attempts failed due to the lack of data. This idea was discussed in a conversation between Peter Thiel and Reed Hoffman hosted by Neil Ferguson at Stanford in 2018. Thiel posited that AI appears to favor centralization, an aspect that supports the principles of central planning.</p></div>

<div id="Ch4.S12.SS7.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS7.p1.1">On the other hand, some suggest that capitalist competition could result in the creation of AGI that cannot be controlled. Dr. Jeffrey Hinton, a vocal advocate of this view, argues that AI’s potential to disrupt business models could drive companies to recklessly pursue advancements in AI to stay competitive. This could lead to increased state power as people become more reliant on the state in an AI-dominated economy, potentially resulting in increased authoritarianism.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S12.SS10.p1.1">Given these diverse viewpoints, it seems that the potential of AI to either aid authoritarianism or promote freedom is yet to be fully explored. However, the inherent ability of democracies to encourage disagreement and diverse perspectives may serve as a counterbalance to the potential of AI for authoritarian control. Moreover, AI’s capacity as a catalytic force in societal organization should not be underestimated. The increasing discourse around AI and its implications for labor and technology usage suggests that AI technology is reshaping the world in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago. Its capabilities in data analysis, decision making, and automation are transforming industries and redefining the scope of what’s possible.</p></div>

<p id="Ch4.S12.SS12.p1.1">Open-source AI can be a vehicle for widespread innovation. It can spur creativity, leading to breakthroughs in various sectors, from healthcare and education to energy and transportation. Open-source technologies facilitate collaboration, accelerate the pace of research, and democratize access, enabling researchers and developers across the globe to contribute to the expansion of AI’s capabilities.

<div id="Ch4.S12.SS13.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS13.p1.1">However, as beneficial as open-source AI may appear, the complexity of global politics can make the transition challenging. A landscape where AI technologies are open-source and freely available brings about potential dilemmas in various areas including national security, economic competitiveness, intellectual property rights, and data privacy.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>4.12.14 </span>National Security and Open-source AI</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S12.SS14.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS14.p1.1">To start, national security is a primary concern. AI has a myriad of applications in defense and security sectors, many of which could potentially be exploited by adversarial entities. As such, unrestricted access to AI technologies could pose a risk to nations’ security. Nevertheless, it is crucial to note that security risks also stem from concentrated AI power. A handful of nations or corporations owning the majority of AI developments may lead to destabilization, power imbalance, and heightened global tensions.</p></div>

<span>4.12.15 </span>Economic Competitiveness and Open-source AI</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S12.SS15.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS15.p1.1">Economic competitiveness is another intricate aspect. Countries and corporations are engaged in a fiercely competitive race to advance in AI technologies, recognizing the economic gains and strategic advantages tied to AI leadership. Open-source AI might challenge this dynamic, disrupting traditional models of competition. However, it could also create an environment of shared growth, leading to a more balanced global AI landscape.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>4.12.16 </span>Intellectual Property Rights and Open-source AI</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S12.SS16.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS16.p1.1">Intellectual property rights form another complex dimension in the discussion. Open-source AI challenges traditional notions of ownership and patents, potentially undermining the incentives for companies and individuals to invest in AI research and development. Balancing the need for innovation with the necessity to protect inventors’ rights becomes critical in an open-source framework.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>4.12.19 </span>Conclusion</h5>
<div id="Ch4.S12.SS19.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS19.p1.1">In conclusion, making AI open-source and freely available represents a shift from the status quo, with both promising potentials and daunting challenges. A global AI framework that upholds democratic principles and values, promotes shared prosperity, and safeguards security and privacy is the aspiration. To achieve this, an inclusive and multidimensional discourse is essential, involving governments, corporations, civil society, academia, and individual citizens. It is through this collective effort that AI’s true potential can be harnessed for the global good.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S12.SS19.p2">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS19.p2.1">There is skepticism the idea of artificial general intelligence (AGI) leading to superintelligent machines that threaten humanity in the near future. This supposed risk of AGI is described as a "red herring" - an unfounded fear. The reasons given are:</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S12.SS19.p3">
<ul id="Ch4.S12.I1">
<li id="Ch4.S12.I1.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S12.I1.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.I1.i1.p1.1">We do not have a clear understanding or definition of general intelligence or consciousness.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch4.S12.I1.i2">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S12.I1.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.I1.i2.p1.1">Current AI like large language models are limited in scope. They are good at statistical pattern matching in language, not generally intelligent.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch4.S12.I1.i3">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch4.S12.I1.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch4.S12.I1.i3.p1.1">The hypothesis that intelligence and consciousness emerge simply from increasing computational power is unproven. There are likely other components we don’t understand.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="Ch4.S12.SS19.p4">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS19.p4.1">The real risk is perhaps government control and regulation of AI development and applications, justified by arguing it is needed for safety and responsible AI. This could impose limits on acceptable speech and thought. Centralised entities could become gatekeepers for how people access and interpret information about the world. Mandating allowable language could narrow ideas and speech to fit an official narrative. Fears of AGI, even if exaggerated, open the door for regulators and bureaucrats to intervene in the name of safety. The risk is not AGI itself but the government control that hype about it enables.</p></div>
<div id="Ch4.S12.SS19.p5">
<p id="Ch4.S12.SS19.p5.1">There is speculation that AI will automate many white collar cognitive jobs, similar to how industrial machinery automated manual labor. This may "chase humans up the value stack" as lower value work is handled by AI, freeing people to focus on higher value creative activities.

<h3>
<span>Chapter 5 </span>Distributed Identity &amp; Trust</h3>
<div id="Ch5.p1">
<p id="Ch5.p1.1">For distributed Web3, and by extension metaverse applications to flourish it is necessary to solve the identification problem <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx147" title="">147</a>]</cite>. Without a <a href="https://joshgans.medium.com/web3-isnt-going-to-work-without-identification-6aa776d674" title="">solution to this</a> bots, scammers, and AI actors will reduce usefulness and usability of and already quite arcane user experience.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.p2">
<p id="Ch5.p2.1">This chapter is an oddity because most of traditional DID/SSI isn’t really fit for purpose. Distributed self sovereign identity has a great elevator pitch though. Individuals should be empowered through technology to manage their own data, without manipulation or exploitation by centralised corporate behemoths. In practice it’s a staggeringly complex proposition which increases risk to the individual, decreases convenience, and despite much work, does not even make much sense in it’s own terms. Webs of trust are viable so this means Nostr, <a href="https://github.com/project-bitmark/marking/wiki#marking" title="">Marking</a>, or Slashtags which will be discussed, but are early products. </p></div>
<section id="Ch5.S1">
<h4>
<span>5.1 </span>Applications of DID/SSI</h4>
<div id="Ch5.S1.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S1.p1.1">Some of the likely, and discussed applications for DID/SSI are the more inherently private and personally valuable sets of data an individual might generate throughout their life. The theory is that subsets of such data could then be digitally revealed by the individual when required, and that cryptographic verification built into the system would guarantee the veracity of the data to the receiving party. It is also possible to make use of “zero-knowledge proof” such that assertions can be made about about the contents of the data without revealing the data itself. A good example of this an age verification challenge, where a threshold age could be asserted without necessarily revealing the date of birth.
Other keystone uses of the technology are:</p><ul id="Ch5.S1.I1">
<li id="Ch5.S1.I1.i1">
<span>•</span>

</li>
<li id="Ch5.S1.I1.i2">

</li>
<li id="Ch5.S1.I1.i3">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch5.S1.I1.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S1.I1.i3.p1.1">financial record and relationships with those of others</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch5.S1.I1.i4">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch5.S1.I1.i4.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S1.I1.i4.p1.1">contacts, connections to other people and their appropriate data, including things like shared and personal calendars</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch5.S1.p1.2">It’s also possible to extend this key management ethos to all login credentials, and all data currently stored on centralised servers. This is the tension discussed in the chapter about Web3. Proponents think that using something like a DID/SSI stack to manage encryption, decryption and access to data within cloud services gives the user the best of all worlds. They see simply logging in with a cryptographic wallet, and using that same public/private key pair to manage the data beyond as some kind of panacea. This is very complex stuff though, and it seems very likely they just haven’t thought this through enough.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>5.2 </span>Classic DID/SSI</h4>
<div id="Ch5.S2.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S2.p1.1">Distributed identity / self sovereign identity has been extensively researched for decades, with hundreds of peer reviewed papers, and extensive support from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" title="">world wide web consortium</a>. The academic field now seems quite ossified and has settled on a couple of hundred ‘schema’ which they feel underpin the next layer of development. It is a <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/overview-of-decentralized-identity-standards-f82efd9ab6c7" title="">complex field</a>, and the language and diagrams are arcane and self referential as seen in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch5.F1" title="Figure 5.1 ‣ 5.2 Classic DID/SSI ‣ Chapter 5 Distributed Identity &amp; Trust ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>5.1</span></a>.</p></div>

</figure>
<div id="Ch5.S2.p2">
<p id="Ch5.S2.p2.1">.
Moreover the minimal implementation of such proposed systems hints at a <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/perma-id/" title="">federated model</a> of <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/947#issuecomment-1276186406" title="">centralised/federated ‘truth’</a> to enable persistence of identifiers over time.
<br>The major failing of the DID/SSI work to date is a lack of meaningful use cases with incentives for adoption. This is clearly explained by Lockwood <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx148" title="">148</a>]</cite> who proposes that the pathway to adoption of ‘classic’ DID/SSI requires an incentive over and above the current identity management on the web. Being distributed is not enough. Especially in the light of questionable assurances of this even being true.
<br>Perhaps most concerning is this <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Mar/thread.html" title="">recent exchange</a> on the mailing lists. Here, two long standing developers of DID say the following:
<br><span id="Ch5.S2.p2.1.1">“Not a single entity I know that’s doing production deployments has actually vetted did:ion and found it to be production capable. This goes for every DLT-based DID Method out there - even the one we’re working on. I am highly sceptical of anyone that says that any DID Method is ready for production usage at present.
<br>Agreed — as one of the proponents of DLTs (in particular permissionless public ones) none are mature enough yet for production.”</span>.
It seems then that we can rule out use of these technologies?</p></div>

<h6>DID principles</h6>
<div id="Ch5.S2.SS0.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S2.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1">The core principles of distributed identity are that there should be persistent identifiers, like real world documents which assert identity, but with extended use cases. These should be permanent, and resolvable everywhere, forever. Underpinning this is cryptographically verifiable and decentralised data, managed by the user, or their trusted proxy. As primitives this makes them lifetime digital assets, that are portable, and unconfiscatable, with no required reliance on a trusted third party. By this stage in the book you should be familiar with these concepts, but application of this fundamental mindset to all personal data and digital interactions is a bigger reach even than money and value.</p></div>

<h6>What’s in a DID document?</h6>
<div id="Ch5.S2.SS0.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S2.SS0.SSSx2.p1.1">All classic DID is underpinned by a DID document what bootstrap the services it’s connected to. It is made up of one or more public keys. The documents can make use of services such as timestamps, cryptographic signatures, proofs, delegations, and authorisations. They should contain the minimum amount of information to accomplish the specific task required of them.</p></div>

<p id="Ch5.S3.p1.2"><span id="Ch5.S3.p1.2.1">The biggest mistake I made was
continuing to invest in building tools
for us to manage the public conversation versus building tools for the people using Twitter to easily manage it for themselves this burdened the company with too much power and opened us to significant outside pressure such as advertising budgets. I generally think companies have become far too powerful. The only way I know of to truly live up to these three principles is a free and open protocol for social media that is not owned by a single company or group of companies and is resilient to corporate and government influence the problem today is that we have companies who own both the protocol and discovery of content which ultimately puts one person in charge of what’s available and seen or not this is by definition a single point of failure no matter how great the person and over time will fracture the public conversation and may lead to more control by governments and
corporations around the world.</span></p></div>

<p id="Ch5.S3.SS2.p1.1">Promisingly Jack Dorsey’s company TBD is working on a project <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/" title="">called “Web5”</a>. Details are scant but the promise is decentralised and/or self hosted data and identity running on Bitcoin, without recourse to a new token. <span id="Ch5.S3.SS2.p1.1.1">“Components include decentralized identifiers (DIDs), decentralized web node (DWNs), self-sovereign identity service (SSIS) and a self-sovereign identity software development kit (ssi-sdk)”</span>.</p></div>

Many existing DID networks are permissionless blockchains which achieve the above goals but with relatively poor latency (ION takes roughly 20 minutes for commitment finality).

In addition (in the current implementation) an identity proof does not need to be published to be valid, just timestamped. In this way an identity can be stolen and used years later to claim later chains of proof. It seems that it might be somewhat useful ‘at scale’ and is worth additional monitoring and investigation, especially given it’s integration into TBD - Web5.

<p id="Ch5.S3.SS3.p1.1">Slashtags is a distributed identity open method being developed by Bitfinex and Tether under the Synonym suite. It’s origins date back to 2011 and was initially seeded through academia, and government innovation grants to build on the concepts of BitTorrent, and later <a href="https://dat-ecosystem.org/timeline.html" title="">DAT</a>. This eventually became the Hypercore protocol, with an additional rebranding to Holepunch in 2021. It is essentially this system, a mobile app UX, and Bitcoin integration which forms the Synonym/Slashtags stack. There is a lot of historical investment, new focus, and promising product design in the Synonym ecosystem which is forming about the this ‘web of trust’ distributed data system. The suite will rely on Pear Credits to enable Tether dollars to be passed around within the system. This may foster adoption in emerging markets. The critical path nature of the Tether integration, and the complex intermingling of Synonym, Hypercore, Bitfinex, Tether, and Pear credits are potentially red flags, and though the technology stack is quite interesting only Pear Credit are really useful to our design.</p></div>

<div id="Ch5.S3.SS4.p2">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS4.p2.1">Phase one focuses on creating a marketplace built on top of Nostr, an interoperable communication protocol. This allows different services like Paxful, HODL HODL, or Nostr app to communicate and operate across each other.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>5.3.5 </span>Nostr</h5>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p1.1">Nostr [pronounced no-star] is a <a href="https://www.nostr.how/" title="">decentralized open protocol</a> that aims to improve the social media experience by addressing issues of censorship and data collection. The protocol operates by allowing users to post and view notes on servers called relays, and view and post these notes through apps called clients. The open nature of the protocol allows for competition and a free flow of information, as users can choose to use different relays or clients if they are censored. This is because the protocol is decentralized and controlled by no one.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p2">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p2.1">The decentralized nature of Nostr means that there is no central authority that can control the flow of information. This is achieved through the use of relays and clients, which are run by different individuals or entities. Users have the freedom to choose which relays and clients they want to use, and as a result, their feeds are populated with content from the people they choose to follow. If a relay or client tries to censor a user, they can simply switch to a different one. This is a major advantage over traditional centralized social media platforms where one entity holds all the control over the flow of information and can censor or manipulate the content that users see.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p3">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p3.1">Nostr is also not beholden to shareholders or investors. This means that the protocol can make decisions that prioritize the well-being and quality of discourse for users, rather than solely focusing on profit. This is in contrast to traditional social media networks like Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok, which are driven by the need to collect data on users and sell ads to generate revenue. In these centralized platforms, users’ data is collected, analyzed and sold to the highest bidder, often without the user’s knowledge or consent. Nostr, on the other hand, allows users to have more control over their data and the ability to monetize their content.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p4">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p4.1">Nostr also tightly integrates Bitcoin Lightning to support the protocol. This will hopefully enable secure transmission of value alongside the information and interactions on the platform. It also gives users the ability to monetise their content.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p5">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p5.1">This potential step-change improvement to the social media experience for everyday people addresses issues of censorship and data collection.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p6">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p6.1">Nostr is “The simplest open protocol that is able to create a censorship-resistant global "social" network once and for all.” according to it’s <a href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr" title="">github page</a>. More than that it’s a client side validated proof of who a user is interacting with, hence being in this identity section. To be clear, it’s not a completely peer to peer system in that it uses (very dumb) relay servers, but this gives it some of the best characteristics of both paradigms.

It can provide message passing. If all entities in the collaborative mixed reality scenegraphs are also Nostr key pairs then schema can be applied consistently with the economic layer using the same key system as Bitcoin. Nostr has just received a substantial grant from Dorsey. It is core to the design later in the book. A curated list of projects and libraries is <a href="https://github.com/aljazceru/awesome-nostr" title="">available on github</a>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p7">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p7.1">Luke Childs <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/issues/154" title="">says</a>:
<span id="Ch5.S3.SS5.p7.1.1">“Nostr makes a good candidate to be used as a very simple DID layer. Having "Login with Nostr" auth on websites solves a lot of problems in a very elegant way, and Nostr’s main use case as a social network protocol makes it highly suited to be used as your main identity proving key. Compare "Login with Nostr" to similar "Login with Lightning" (LNURL-auth) specs to see some easy and obvious advantages:
<br>Remote signer vs local signer
<br>Login with Lightning requires access to remote keys, login with Nostr requires access to local keys ideally stored in a browser extension. Due to the way Lightning works you can only really have one instance. You need all your client devices linked to a single Lightning node, this means most clients will be connecting to the signer remotely. Now if your Lightning node goes down or you lose your connection you also can’t auth with any service. This could cause circular dependencies where you lose the connection to your Lightning node so you can’t auth with the services you need to access to debug the issue with your Lightning node like your hosting provider or VPN account. You could technically solve this by replicating your LN keys to other client devices only to be used for local auth signing but that introduces other risks.
<br>Unique identifier vs identity
<br>A Lightning node is not really an identity but a unique identifier. It just tells you the person that auths is the same random person that authed last time, it doesn’t tell you who they are. A nostr pubkey is an identity. It tells you who they are, what their name is, what they look like, who they know, how you can pay them, how you can message them.
<br>This is much more useful as an identity layer for an application. The application can show their profile picture, username, send secure cross platform push notifications via NIP-04 encrypted Nostr DMs, etc.
<br>Consistent identity across services
<br>Lightning pubkeys are sensitive private information and can leak confidential financial information, Nostr pubkeys are safe to share with anyone. LNURL-auth adds extra steps to solve this by creating derived subkeys for identities that are unique to each service you auth with. This does not seem ideal, it seems the default case is that an identity is something that you do want to follow you across all your accounts. Nostr based auth behaves more appropriate in this regard. In the rare case you need to achieve privacy and separation between certain services you can still do that by using use a throwaway Nostr key for those services.
<br>User relationships across services
Since authing with Nostr shares a real social identity with the service, they can also see your Nostr social graph. This could be useful for connecting you to people you already know on the new service.
<br>Low cost identity
<br>Ideally identities should be easy to create but hard to build up reputation to limit spam while avoiding excluding people from the network. It’s not clear that it will be cost effective / scalable for everyone to run their own Lightning node so tying individual identity to a single Lightning node pubkey is problematic.

<h6>NIP-05</h6>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx1.p1.1">At this time, the nascent identity layer in nostr leans on NIP-05. This is a distributed identity management system that maps Nostr keys to DNS-based internet identifiers. In events of kind 0 (setmetadata), the “nip05” key can have an internet identifier as its value. Clients split the identifier into the local part and domain and make a GET request to the specified URL. The response should be a JSON document with a “names” key containing a mapping of names to hex-formatted public keys. If the public key matches the one from the setmetadata event, the client accepts the association and considers the “nip05” identifier valid.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx1.p2.1">Clients may find users’ public keys from internet identifiers by first fetching the well-known URL and then checking for a matching “nip05”. When following public keys, clients must prioritize the keys over NIP-05 addresses. Public keys must be in hex format. Clients can enable user discovery through search boxes, allowing users to find profiles by entering internet identifiers. The identifier can be used as the “root” identifier, displayed as just the domain. The protocol supports both dynamic and static servers by using the local part as a query string.</p></div>

<section id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx2">
<h6>Nostr Protocol as the keystone</h6>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx2.p1.1">The Nostr protocol can be used to store and share valuable content across the network. This is ably demonstrated by the <a href="https://highlighter.com/" title="">‘Highlighter’ project</a> which allows users to store important notes from around the web using nostr. In the context of our federated social media trust model, the Nostr protocol can serve as the underlying layer that connects various instances of virtual spaces, thus enabling seamless data exchange and interoperability among them. Highlighter demonstrates that nostr events can be leveraged to create, store, and interact with valuable across networks. By utilizing this concept, we can extend the functionality to support federated social media trust, allowing users to carry their reputation, identity, and cryptographic proofs across different virtual spaces and social media platforms.</p></div>

<h6>Integrating Cryptographic Proofs and Reputation</h6>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx4.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx4.p1.1">To create a trusted environment within the federated network, we must establish a mechanism for importing and verifying cryptographic proofs from various sources, such as social media sites and other digital platforms. By doing so, we enable users to bring their existing reputation and trust from these platforms into the new ecosystem, thus facilitating trust-based interactions and collaboration within the network. We can leverage the Nostr protocol and the NIP05 specification to import these cryptographic proofs, creating a secure and verifiable system for identity management and trust propagation. The NIP05 specification allows for the creation and verification of identity proofs within the Nostr protocol, thus enabling the seamless integration of trust and reputation data from external sources.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx4.p2">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx4.p2.1">By utilizing the Nostr protocol as the underlying layer, we can establish connections between objects, people, and AI actors within the federated network. This interconnected ecosystem allows for seamless collaboration, information sharing, and trust-based interactions among all participants. The open-source collaboration infrastructure we propose can facilitate the development of various applications and services that leverage the federated network, such as virtual workspaces, AI-assisted creativity tools, and more. The uncensorable nature of this protocol further supports the inclusivity and accessibility we feel so important, ensuring that participants from different regions and backgrounds can take part in the digital society and contribute to its growth.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx4.p3">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx4.p3.1">This federated social media trust model, built on the Nostr protocol, allows for the establishment of a robust, inclusive, and trust-based network that connects various virtual spaces, social media platforms, and AI systems. By leveraging the lessons learned from the other attempts in the space, and by maximising the inclusion of external cryptographic proofs from multiple sources, we can create a comprehensive trust system that fosters collaboration, innovation, and shared growth within the digital society.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx4.p4">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx4.p4.1">The Nostr protocol, with its decentralized and open-source nature, provides a solid foundation for linking and federating objects, people, and AI actors across collaborative spaces in digital society. By leveraging the Nostr protocol, we can build a robust and trust-based network that interconnects various virtual spaces, social media platforms, and AI systems. One of the key aspects of this trust-based network is the ability to import cryptographic proofs from different sources, similar to Keybase’s approach to importing proofs from various social media sites <a href="https://book.keybase.io/account#proofs" title="">(Keybase Proofs)</a>.</p></div>

<h6>StrFry relays</h6>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx5.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx5.p1.1">The Stirfry relay software provides high-performance infrastructure for building decentralized social media applications on top of the Noster protocol. As an open source project written in C++, Stirfry emphasizes efficiency, flexibility, and community-driven governance.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx5.p2">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx5.p2.1">At the core of Stirfry is its high-speed database engine. Rather than using a traditional SQL database, Stirfry implements the Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) - an embedded key-value store optimized for performance. Reads are lock-free, enabling unlimited parallel query throughput. Writes require only a short-held lock, ensuring minimal interference. LMDB’s "shadow paging" design allows isolated read-only transactions via multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). This prevents reads from blocking writes and vice versa.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx5.p3">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx5.p3.1">To maximize database performance, Stirfry stores Noster events directly in FlatBuffers - an efficient binary format allowing direct access without serialization. The original JSON payloads are preserved to facilitate transmission back to clients. Additional database files index events on fields like timestamps and authors, accelerating filter queries. Periodic compaction optimizes the layout for faster operations.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx5.p4">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx5.p4.1">Stirfry adopts a multi-threaded, modular architecture. A websocket thread accepts new client connections and routes incoming requests. An ingester thread validates and pre-processes each request before passing to appropriate handlers. Doing signature checks and filter compilation upfront avoids repeating work. A single writer thread batches database writes to amortize transaction overhead. Multiple worker threads handle read queries, fairly scheduling between long and short requests. Dedicated monitor threads track active filters and stream matching events to subscribed clients. Passing messages between threads instead of sharing data structures improves efficiency.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx5.p5">
<p id="Ch5.S3.SS5.SSSx5.p5.1">Additional features further enhance Stirfry’s capabilities. Graceful shutdown support allows stopping new connections while existing ones complete. Hot configuration reloading provides runtime updates without restarting. Flexible write policy plugins enable custom content moderation. Streaming websocket compression and Zstandard dictionaries compress traffic. Syncing protocols like Negentropy facilitate efficient relay replication, powering mesh network topologies. Geo-replication by the relay.org community offers low latency worldwide access. The custom Templar HTML templating library assists crafting simple, fast decentralized frontends.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>5.4 </span>Micropayment based web</h4>
<div id="Ch5.S4.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S4.p1.1">It seems the war against disinformation is now being lost. Much is written in the media about Deepfake technology creating plausible fake videos, but probably more pernicious is the use of toolkits to create entire plausible fake news sites using natural language AI such as GPT3. This makes it cheap to publish potentially market moving news which is then rehypothecated by online news vendors who are hungry for clicks. As these pipelines become more mature it will be difficult to keep fake news for financial or political gain out of the system. One interesting way to do this that <span id="Ch5.S4.p1.1.1">isn’t</span> webs of trust or true cryptographic identity is to charge micropayments for “one to many” publication models. This would imply a tiny instant payment for clicks, especially on social media sites such as twitter. This kind of model has been discussed but is only possible in the context of systems such as Lightning where instant micropayment can be realised. It seems possible that this would price out speculative ‘noise’ spam from the information space. It’s interesting and ironic that the origin of proof of work was to underpin just such a spam defeating system <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx17" title="">17</a>]</cite>, and that Nakamoto <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015014.html" title="">mentioned this application for Bitcoin</a> back in 2009. There is now much chatter about the integration of Bitcoin with Twitter in light of Musks buyout of the social network.

<h4>
<span>5.5 </span>Are DAOs useful for us?</h4>
<div id="Ch5.S5.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S5.p1.1">A distributed autonomous organisation, or DAO is a governance structure which is built in distributed code on a blockchain smart contract system. Token holders have voting rights proportional to their holding. The first decentalised autonomous organisation was simply called “The DAO” and was launched on the Ethereum network in 2016 after raising around $100M. <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-what-is-a-dao" title="">It quickly succumbed to a hack and the money was drained</a>. This event was an important moment in the development of Ethereum and resulted in a code fork which preserves two separate versions of the network to this day, though one is falling into obsolescence. Again, this is covered in Shin’s book on the period in extreme detail, but it seems this stuff is falling into dusty history now, leaving only a somewhat tarnished and technically shaky legacy <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx31" title="">31</a>]</cite>. 
<br>In practice DAOs have very few committed ‘stakeholders’ and the same names seem to crop up across multiple projects. Some crucial community decisions within large projects only poll a couple of dozen eligible participants. Its might be that the experiment of distributed governance is failing at this stage.</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S5.p2">
<p id="Ch5.S5.p2.1">Perhaps more interesting is the use of the DAO concept to crowd fund global projects, currently especially for the acquisition of important art or cultural items. DAOs are also emerging as a way to fund promising technology projects, though this is reminiscent of the 2017 ICO craze which ended badly and is likely to <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8590-22" title="">fall foul of regulations</a>.</p></div>

<h6>Problems experienced to date</h6>
<div id="Ch5.S5.SS0.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch5.S5.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1">DAOs exist in a gray area with unclear legal recognition, leading to challenges in fitting into existing legal frameworks and regulatory systems. This lack of clarity raises concerns about how DAOs can comply with laws and regulations, potentially leading to legal disputes or conflicts with regulatory authorities.
Security Risks and Technological Vulnerabilities:</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S5.SS0.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch5.S5.SS0.SSSx1.p2.1">Given their reliance on blockchain technology and smart contracts, DAOs are vulnerable to cyber threats, such as hacking and exploitation of code weaknesses. The decentralized nature of DAOs can further complicate security management and responses to breaches, raising concerns about the safety of assets and data managed by DAOs.
Governance Inefficiencies and Democratic Deficiencies:</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S5.SS0.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch5.S5.SS0.SSSx1.p3.1">The non-hierarchical structure of DAOs, while innovative, may lead to governance challenges, including potential inefficiencies in decision-making processes. There’s also a risk of DAOs deviating from democratic principles, possibly leading to control by a limited group of technologically adept individuals (technocracy) or oligarchic tendencies, which could marginalize participants who are less tech-savvy.
Fragmentation and Complexity in Governance Models:</p></div>
<div id="Ch5.S5.SS0.SSSx1.p4">
<p id="Ch5.S5.SS0.SSSx1.p4.1">The existence of multiple, simultaneous governance models within DAOs can lead to fragmentation, resulting in a lack of coherent and unified governance. This complexity can create confusion among participants and hinder effective decision-making, posing challenges to the democratic functioning and overall effectiveness of DAOs.</p></div>

<h3>
<span>Chapter 6 </span>Digital Objects &amp; NFTs</h3>
<div id="Ch6.p1">
<p id="Ch6.p1.1">Nonfungible tokens are a whole ‘class’ of digital token, separate and distinct from everything discussed to this point. They are generally <a href="https://www.signaturelitigation.com/nfts-recognised-as-property-lavinia-deborah-osbourne-v-1-persons-unknown-2-ozone-networks-inc-trading-as-opensea/" title="">recognised in law</a> as property in their own right <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx149" title="">149</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx150" title="">150</a>]</cite>. In the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and project tokens detailed earlier, and limiting this description to the Ethereum network for now, a project launching an ERC-20 token commits contract code to the blockchain, and this contract then mediates the issuance and management of millions or billions of tokens associated with that project, and it’s use case. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/" title="">ERC-20</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility" title="">fungible</a> token issuance. Each of the projects’ tokens is interchangeable with any other token. They’re all the same from the point of view of the user.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.p2">
<p id="Ch6.p2.1">Rather than the ERC-20 contract type used for fungible token issuance NTFs predominantly use ERC-721 protocol on Ethereum (just different instructions). It’s the case that most NFTs in the 2021/2 hype bubble are algorithmically generated sets of themed art (so called PFP-NFT). Tens of thousands of distinct tokens are ‘minted’, each one being a complex transaction commitment to the Ethereum blockchain, along with it’s associated gas fee. These minting events were much hyped social occasions (before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/02/nft-sales-hit-12-month-low-after-cryptocurrency-crash?" title="">2022 market crash</a>), and happened very quickly, with users clamouring to create art with randomly allocated features from the art schema associated with the project. Lucky winners could find themselves with an NFT art piece with more than an average number of ‘rare’ features. If the overall mint becomes more popular, then the secondary market for all of those mints goes up, and because of the liquidity premium they can go up a lot. The perceived rarer mints go up a lot more. This whole process is <a href="https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053" title="">very energy intensive</a> on the chain, and the vast majority of these project simply <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/non-fungible-tokens-can-we-predict-price-theyll-sell" title="">trend to zero value</a>. In response to this appalling cost benefit analysis the Ethereum foundation have proposed <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2309" title="">EIP-2309</a> to make minting NFTs more efficient. They say “This standard lets you mint as many as you like in one transaction!”</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.p3">
<p id="Ch6.p3.1">The Ethereum foundation give their somewhat constrained view of <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/nft/" title="">NFTs on their website</a> and it’s a useful primer. On that page they detail some of the use cases, as listed below, with a critique added:</p><ul id="Ch6.S0.I1">

<div id="Ch6.S0.I1.i5.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S0.I1.i5.p1.1">Investments and collateral; while this was an emergent option in the space, it’s likely been a bubble, as owners of the tokens cast around for additional liquidity, and loan businesses chased yield with higher risk. The <a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/three-arrows-capital-grayscale-maker-lido" title="">recent implosion</a> of lenders and funds in the crypto space was partly a function of supposedly world class risk managers accepting jpegs as collateral.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch6.p3.2">Moving away from Ethereum, NFTs can be minted on most of the other level one chains. Solana is a great newcomer example. Sol is a terrible chain with regards to decentralisation, but thanks to that it’s far cheaper and faster to mint NFTs on it, and it was becoming a <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ethereum-eth-killers-nfts-defi-solana-cardano-wax-crypto-investing-2022-1" title="">troubling competitor</a> for Eth before the FTX ponzi scheme collapse destroyed it’s market value (Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch6.F1" title="Figure 6.1 ‣ Chapter 6 Digital Objects &amp; NFTs ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>6.1</span></a>).</p></div>

<div id="Ch6.p4">
<p id="Ch6.p4.1">The same might be true for Cardano’s ADA, though ADA is struggling to hold onto it’s market position despite some technical advances. It’s worth reiterating here that the nature of these digital tools likely makes for a ‘winner take all’ market dynamic over time. With fees being central to this generative NFT use case it’s possible to see that highly centralised, fast, and cheap chains will capture and eventually dominate the space. Remember that this likely (game theoretic) outcome might as well be a database running without the stark inefficiencies of blockchain. The whole NFT space is a gamble on consumer enthusiasm for spending money continuing to outpace logic.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.p5">
<p id="Ch6.p5.1">Astonishingly, according to a JPMorgan insider market report (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-breakdown-with-nlw/jpmorgan-bitcoin-shows-some-merit-as-a-store-of-value/" title="">reported on in a podcast</a>), only around 2 million people have ever actually interacted with NFTs. One analysis suggests that a single entity accounts for 3 of the top 4 holders, having made 32,000 ETH from the NFT boom. This suggests heavy market manipulation and is far from the egalitarian landscape claimed in the hype. Tellingly it’s thought around <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/three-arrows-wanted-100m-nft-161811450.html" title="">10% of the trading volume</a> on market leading platform ‘Super Rare’ was by the now bankrupt venture capital firm ‘Three Arrows’.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.p6">
<p id="Ch6.p6.1">With that said NFTs have clearly allowed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_non-fungible_tokens" title="">digital and new media artists</a> to connect with audiences without gatekeepers. Established mediators and curators of art have been caught totally wrongfooted, and NFTs seem to give a way for them to be cut out completely. There are suggestions of applications beyond this initial digital art scope. This is a compounding, and disrupting paradigm change.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>6.1.1 </span>Art</h5>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.p1.1">The recent surge of interest in NFT’s during early 2021 has largely been
driven by digital art NFT’s, despite the origins of digital art NFT’s
started much earlier in 2014. New York artist <a href="https://www.mccoyspace.com/project/125/" title="">Kevin McCoy’s
<em id="Ch6.S1.SS1.p1.1.1.1">Quantum</em></a> is widely recognised as the first piece of art created
as an NFT. However it was during early 2021 that art NFT’s started to
gain significant attention; by the end of 2021, nearly <a href="https://www.paymentscardsandmobile.com/state-of-the-blockchain-nfts-explode-onto-scene-in-2021/" title="">£31b
had been spent</a> on NFT purchases, a considerable and exponential growth
given <a href="https://raritysniper.com/news/nfts-exploded-in-2021-with-25-billion-in-sales/" title="">2020

<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.p2.1">Art as NFT’s offer the following advantages:</p></div>
<section id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx1">
<h6>Immutable Nominal Authenticity</h6>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx1.p1.1">Art fraud such as false
representation, forgeries, plagiarism have been a reoccurring blight
since art has existed; artists and works of art have been open to
abuse by forgers, black market profiteers and even fellow artists
laying claim to works of art of others. Unless a work of art is sold,
exhibited or listed, documenting when and who created it, the
<em id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx1.p1.1.1">nominal authenticity,</em> which Dutton states as the
<em id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx1.p1.1.2">“correct identification of the origins, authorship, or
provenance of an object”</em> <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx151" title="">151</a>]</cite> can be increasingly mutable over a period
of time, dependent on a multitude of factors, including; the artists
existing profile, how widely and where the work of art is exhibited,
if the work of art is commissioned by a patron, if it’s sold, and
profile of the buyer/collector. At its most basic level, once a work
of art is ‘minted’ as an NFT (publishing the art work as a unique
token on the blockchain) this functions as an immutable publicly
accessible proof of ownership and by extension proof of creation. The
act of minting is not purely limited to digital art; all an artist
requires is a digital representation of any physical art (sculpture,
physical painting, installation etc..) which can be used as a proxy
allowing artists to record the date of creation/origin of a physical
piece of art on the blockchain, a buyer purchasing the NFT can be
provided the actual physical artwork as part of the NFT. Nominal
authenticity becomes secure and immutable for the lifetime of the blockchain (by no means assured).</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx2">
<h6>Secure Digital Provenance</h6>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx2.p1.1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance" title="">Provenance</a> (or the chain of custody) is an important aspect in works of art, antiques and antiquities. Provenance not only helps assign work to an artist but also documents ownership history. Digital provenance, an inherent feature of NFT’s means provenance now no longer becomes what has historically sometime been a contentious detective’s game at the best of times; one that is open to fraud, misinterpretation and entirely reliant on good record keeping.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx2.p2">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx2.p2.1">Since provenance can contribute to the value of a piece of art (benefiting both the creator and collector) the use of the blockchain as an open, secure ledger is a far more trustworthy system than traditional methods of artistic provenance that were cobbled together; often
consisting of a mix of physical and digital documents spanning private
&amp; public sale receipts, art/museum gallery exhibitions and private
record keeping). Digital provenance provided when an artist ‘mints’ a
piece of art into an NFT allows artists and collectors to record a
secure, permanent unalterable history of transactions for a specific
piece of art, providing future collector complete trust in the origin
and custody of a piece of art.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx3">
<h6>Decentralised automated royalty payments</h6>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx3.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx3.p1.1">Traditionally if a piece of art is sold, the first sale may (but not always) benefit the
artist financially, however secondary and any subsequent sales would
only ever financially benefit the buyer/collector; the original artist
would rarely benefit. However If a work of art is minted into an NFT,
royalty payments can be predetermined and automated in perpetuity
directly by the use of a ‘smart contract’. Smart contracts are small,
automated scripts/programs that run automatically and independently of
a buyer/seller; pre-determined conditions are set by the buyer; these
trigger when certain conditions are met i.e. These cannot yet be enforced “on chain” and the NFT auction houses online have engaged in a race to the bottom and stopped enforcing royalty payments through their systems. This element might not even be possible, though there is some hope that we could enable this in the complex logic offered by the RGB protocol.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4">
<h6>On sale transfer</h6>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p1.1">20% of total sale amount into digital wallet of the creator.
80% of total sale amount into digital wallet of the seller.
</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p2">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p2.1">Once the royalty payment rate is set by the artist/creator, future
royalties of all sales can be paid directly to the artist/creator
account (via a digital wallet) without the need of a third party
(traditionally a gallery/agent etc..).</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p3">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p3.1">Smart contract driven NFT’s means that even if piece of art is resold 5,
10 or even a 100,000 times moving through 5, 10 or even a 100,000
different collectors; a pre-determined royalty payment rate set by the
creator would still guarantee the artist/creator is paid directly from
each and every future sale.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p4">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p4.1">Historically provenance for works of art may span across generations,
for instance Gabriël Metsu’s oil on canvas painting <em id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p4.1.1">The Lace
Maker’s</em> provenance, first recorded in 1722, now spans 300 years of
ownership, including from a British Baron in the 19<sup id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p4.1.2">th</sup>
century to an American philanthropist in the 20<sup id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p4.1.3">th</sup>
century.) Metsu died young at the age of 38, leaving a widow; neither
his/her relatives/descendants benefit from his original work, 300 years
later this would be near impossible to facilitate with traditional
systems, as even legal contracts are open and prone to the ravages of
time.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p5">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p5.1">NFT smart contracts hold an incredibly potential; an artists descendants
financially benefiting directly from the resale of a piece of work long
after the artist/museum’s/gallery or even state have turned to dust as
long as the original creator’s digital wallet is accessible, <em id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p5.1.1">the
blockhain becomes an everlasting digital patron</em> ensuring</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p6">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p6.1">NFT art currently suffers from the same failure of decentralisation already discussed in the Ethererum technology stack, but this is compounded by the normalisation of intermediate art brokers <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html" title="">continuing to custody</a> the NFTs even after sale. They are usually selling a pointer to their own servers. The market is nascent and evolving, but it’s currently not delivering on it’s core promise.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p7">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p7.1">Proof of ownership is intuitively a pretty obvious application for the technology, but again it’s hard to justify the expense when the benefits are so slim. <a href="https://www.bullishlybred.com/" title="">Bulldogs on the blockchain</a> is a clear gimmick, and might even incentivise poor behaviours as there are two products here which are not necessarily aligned. Much has been written over the years about <a href="https://propy.com/browse/propy-nft/" title="">deeds to property</a> being passed through blockchains, cutting out the middle man, but in the event that a house deed NFT was hacked and stolen it’s obviously not the case that the property would then pass to the hacker.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p8">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p8.1">One of the most interesting companies is Yuga Labs, who launched the incredibly popular Bored Ape Yacht club set of 10,000 algorithmically generated NFTs. These Ethereum based NFTs were based loosely on the ‘Crypto Punks’ model of PFP-NFT (variously profile picture project, picture for proof, and picture for profile - no definition remains uncontested for long). Yuga launched with a better commercialisation model for the holders, and a strong marketing drive into celebrity circles. They now regularly change hands for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Even this ‘blue chip’ NFT is not without <a href="https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1538909505236283392" title="">serious criticism</a>: <span id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p8.1.1">“I’d put it at 99.99% the project is in fact a deliberate troll, intentionally replete with Nazi symbols and esoteric racist dog whistles”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p9">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p9.1">Yuga recently bought the artistic rights to the commercial reuse of similarly popular (and preceding) Punks set. This is interesting because they have again handed the commercial re-use rights to the owners of the individual NFTs. This raises the same <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-21/bored-ape-nft-spinoff-venture-gone-sour-sparks-legal-fight" title="">confusing problem</a> with attaching commercial rights to an easily stolen token as NFTs for real estate does. This has been demonstrated recently when Seth Green had a Bored Ape stolen after <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/seth-green-bored-ape-stolen-tv-show" title="">creating an animated show around it’s IP</a>. Many more contradictions and ambiguities in NFT licenses are emerging. Galaxy Digital have <a href="https://www.galaxy.com/research/insights/a-survey-of-nft-licenses-facts-and-fictions/" title="">surveyed the landscape</a>:
<span id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p9.1.1">“Contrary to the ethos of Web3, NFTs today convey exactly zero ownership rights for the underlying artwork to their token holders. Instead, the arrangements between NFT issuers and token holders resemble a distinctly web maze of opaque, misleading, complex, and restrictive licensing agreements, and popular secondary markets like OpenSea provide no material disclosures regarding these arrangements to purchasers. Something more is required, and that ‘something’ is a legal agreement between the owner of the image—known as the ‘copyright holder’ and the NFT holder specifying what rights the NFT holder has with respect to the image. To the extent an NFT purchaser has any rights to the image associated with his or her NFT at all, those rights flow not from his or her ownership of the token, but from the terms and conditions contained in the license issued by the NFT Project governing the NFT holder’s purchase and use of the image. Accordingly, for the vast majority of NFT projects, owning the NFT does not mean you own the corresponding digital content that is displayed when you sync your wallet to OpenSea. That content, as it turns out, is owned and retained by the owner of the copyright associated with that digital content, typically the NFT project.
After reviewing the most used license agreements for NFT projects, it becomes apparent that NFT standards and smart contracts do not recognize off-chain law.”</span> There may already be a response from the industry to this in the shape of <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/introducing-nft-licenses/" title="">a16z’s “can’t be evil” license proposal</a>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p10">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p10.1">Even so, the community around these collections is incredibly strong, mixing developers, artists, the rich and famous, and the fortunate and early, into a cohesive community who communicate online. The developer ‘good will’ is enormous, and it seems possible that this will lead to faster and broader innovation around the collections, and out into <a href="https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1505014986556551172?" title="">metaverse applications</a>. The brand is strong, and the individual NFT items both benefit from, and reinforce that brand, while adding personal narratives and human interest.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p11">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p11.1">As a gauge of how frothy this market still is it’s interesting to look at the APE token which Yuga just launched. They airdropped 10,000 of the tokens free to each of the 10,000 NFT holders. This instantly created a multi-billion dollar market cap, and a top 50 ‘crypto’ out of thin air, based purely on their brand. It’s clear that there is both brand, and a market here.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p12">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p12.1">A recent report from "Base Layer" tries to capture the community ‘feature’ of big brand NFTs. <a href="https://baselayer.so/crypto-culture-decoded" title="">“Crypto culture decoded”</a> explains that is is these online communities which are the attraction not necessarily the art. This is a powerful ‘in group’ argument, though speculation remains the most likely underpinning.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p13">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS1.SSSx4.p13.1">While it is likely that this is currently a speculative bubble, that is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61102759" title="">waning already</a> (Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch6.F3" title="Figure 6.3 ‣ On sale transfer ‣ 6.1.1 Art ‣ 6.1 Key use cases ‣ Chapter 6 Digital Objects &amp; NFTs ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>6.3</span></a>), it seems certain that the technology is here to stay in some form.</p></div>

looking to cash in</a> on the huge global interest in retro/second hand
games.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS2.p4">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS2.p4.1">Despite publishers and developers increasingly moving to non-physical
digital only’ games, the demand for used games remains incredibly high.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS2.p5">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS2.p5.1">Whilst some retailers have adapted their business models to include reselling of retro/second hand games, the vast majority of publisher/developers/retailers aren’t able to directly benefit from the
emerging retro/second hand games market. The potential of <em id="Ch6.S1.SS2.p5.1.1">video
games as NFT’s</em> presents a huge opportunity for publishers, developers
and players alike, offering the following advantages:</p></div>
<section id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx1">
<h6>Royalty Sales on Pre-owned Games</h6>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx1.p1.1">; A predetermined proportion
of any resale of a used game can automated in perpetuity via smart
contracts; once these are set by the publisher, future royalties of
all sales can be paid directly to the publishers/developers wallets (a
digital account) without the need of a third party (traditionally a
retail entity). Traditionally only the initial first sale of a game
would financially benefit the publisher/developer/retailer, secondary
and subsequent sales would only ever financially benefit the
purchaser, with many developers/publishers arguing this is hurting the
wider industry through the loss of significant income generated by the
secondary and subsequent sales, sometimes over the course of decades.
However the use of NFT’s smart contracts means that if a game is
sold/resold through 10,000 collectors; a pre-determined royalty
payment rate set by the publisher would still guarantee the publisher
(and or developer/retailer) takes a proportion of any future sales.</p></div>

Genshin Impact</a> (<em id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx2.p1.1.5">9 million players</em> ) all have large, established
and significant player bases. What is noteworthy, the games are designed
to encourage players may spend hundreds, or in some cases thousands of
hours on one game alone; according to
<a href="https://destinytracker.com/destiny/leaderboards/all/minutesplayedtotal?grouped=true&amp;page=1" title="">Destinytracker.com</a>,
the top players have amassed total play times over 20,000 hours, close
to 1,000 days or ~ 3 years, which is incredible feat
given Destiny 2 only launched 5 years ago in 2017.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx2.p2">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx2.p2.1">Destiny/Pokemon Go and Genshin Impact revolve around a central key game
mechanic; players investing significant amounts of time collecting in
game digital assets; characters/weapons/items, often classed as ‘rare’
or ‘exotic’ or ‘5 Star’. These collectibles usually found by a
combination of the accrual of in-game time, completing quests,
purchasing additional in-game items/boosters, and luck (‘RNG’). Players
are often encouraged to share their collections of rare
characters/weapons/ objects through in-game achievements, triumphs,
scores acting as a mark of distinction/status symbol.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx2.p3">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx2.p3.1">Traditionally there has been nothing that went beyond sharing the
<em id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx2.p3.1.1">digital badge</em> (i.e triumph/achievement/accomplishment) on a on
social media/gamer’s platform profile. However NFT’s offer the ideal
system for developers/publishers and even players to monetise user
generated/customised data (such as a players unique save game data), simultaneously allowing:
a) creation of an additional monetised ecosystem to meet player demands
i.e. some players who are willing to monetise and ‘sell’ their invested
time in a particular product/service to other players with little time
but willing to pay other players for ‘grinding’ (progressing laborious
in game tasks) and a more advanced in-game progression point.
The potential to provide publishers/developers with an additional
long-term income stream, providing a better ROI on computer &amp; video
game development, which in many instances can cost hundreds of millions
in development costs spanning 5/10 years, is undeniable.</p></div>

<div id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx4.p5">
<p id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx4.p5.1">The <a href="https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1491270239967154178" title="">following text</a> is from Justin Kan, co-founder of twitch: <span id="Ch6.S1.SS2.SSSx4.p5.1.1">“NFTs are a better business model for games. Many gamers seem to be raging hard against game studios selling NFTs. But NFTs are also better for players. Here’s why I think blockchain games will be the predominant business model in gaming in ten years. NFTs are a better business model for funding games . Example: recently I invested in a new web3 game SynCityHQ. They are building a mafia metaverse and raised $3M in their initial NFT drop.
<br>NFTs give studios access to a new capital market for raising capital from the crowd.NFTs can be a better ongoing model for games. Web3 games will open economies, and by building the games on open and programmable assets (tokens + NFTs) they will create far more economic value than they could from any one game. Imagine Fortnite, but other developers can build experiences on top of the V-Bucks and skins. Epic would get a royalty every time any transaction happens. As big as Fortnite is today, Open Fortnite could be much bigger, because it will be a true platform. NFTs are better for gamers Allowing gamers to have ownership of the assets they buy and earn in game allows them to participate in the potential growth of a game. It lets gamers preserve some economic value when they switch to playing something new. But what about the criticisms of NFTs?
<br>Here are my thoughts on the common FUDs: "It’s just a money grab on the part of the studios!"
<br>Game studios already switched over to the model of selling in-game items, cosmetics, etc to players long ago. But currently the digital stuff players are buying isn’t re-sellable. NFT ownership is strictly better for players. "The games aren’t real games." This reminds me of the criticism of free-to-play in 2008, when the games were Mafia Wars / FarmVille. We haven’t had time for great developers to create incredible experiences yet. Everyone investing in games knows there are great teams building. "Game NFTs aren’t really decentralized because they rely on models / assets inside centralized game clients."
Crypto is as much a movement as it is a technology. Putting items on a blockchain is what gives people trust that they have participatory ownership…which make people willing to buy in to the game. These assets are “backed” by blockchain.
The fact that these item collections are NFTs will make other people willing to build on top of them. "NFTs are bad for the environment." Solana and L2s solve this. NFT games are better for players and for game developers. Like the free-to-play revolution changed gaming, so will blockchain. The games of the future will be fully robust, with open and programmable economies.</span>”</p></div>

<h4>
<span>6.2 </span>Broader and metaverse uses</h4>
<div id="Ch6.S2.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S2.p1.1">So far according to a16z NFTs break down into:</p><ul id="Ch6.S2.I1">
<li id="Ch6.S2.I1.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch6.S2.I1.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S2.I1.i1.p1.1">Profile pictures: These were discussed at the start of the chapter and have felt ubiquitous on Twitter over the last couple of years. The major projects will likely hold value, but the hype cycle will likely lead to all profile NFTs going in and out of fashion. There’s potentially a fresh wave of this same kind of low key identity hype possible in the metaverse, and indeed the two plausible both intersect and converge.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch6.S2.I1.i2">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch6.S2.I1.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S2.I1.i2.p1.1">Art and Music: Art has also been discussed above. Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who founded PayPal has invested in expanded NTF use cases. The first is ‘Royal’ which is experimentally <a href="https://royal.io/" title="">selling limited NFT tokens</a> which contractually entitle the holder to a portion of music artist royalties. Spotify are experimenting with music NFTs (and of course in the metaverse). This is an early adopter area, and again likely converges with our planned uses cases as more complex tooling appears. For instance Tim Exile of <a href="https://endlesss.fm/" title="">Endless.fm</a> talks about digital assets extending to the building blocks of co-created music, and wished to build a music creator economy which distributes value to creators at the instant of the final value transaction with the consumer.</p></div>

<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch6.S2.I1.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S2.I1.i3.p1.1">Gaming: As discussed there’s pushback from the gaming community, but huge investment from the likes of Lego, Blizzard, Epic, Ubisoft etc.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch6.S2.I1.i4">

<div id="Ch6.S2.I1.i4.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S2.I1.i4.p1.1">Gig tickets: Not only the straightforward use of <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/psg-sells-us-220-000-030927515.html" title="">transferable tickets for events</a> as NFTs on a blockchain (which is impossible due to the cost right now) but also onward monetisation of ticket stubs as memorabilia. The NBA is <a href="https://deadspin.com/investing-in-nft-ticket-stubs-is-likely-one-of-the-nba-1848991991" title="">already looking at this</a>.
<br><span id="Ch6.S2.I1.i4.p1.1.1">“The team sells the ticket for face value many many years ago, but when that stub is being sold now for much more many times over, the team gets none of that money,” York explained. “But with an NFT stub that changes. Let’s say a new rookie enters the NBA next season and he turns out to be the next LeBron James. That ticket stub from his first game, as an NFT, the team can put a commission on it — 20 percent or however much, the NBA decides that. In 10 years when it’s worth a lot of money, I or whoever owns that NFT, can sell it for say $100,000. The NBA can still collect 20 percent of that sale, because it’s all on a smart contract.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S2.I1.i4.p2">
<p id="Ch6.S2.I1.i4.p2.1">It seems so obvious that this will extend to the virtual events space in the metaverse.</p></div>

<div id="Ch6.S2.I1.i5.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S2.I1.i5.p1.1">Utility: These are broadly ‘membership’ style tokens, and this seems like a sensible fit. Peter Thiel (again) for instance launches a <a href="https://www.ztonft.com/" title="">political funding NFT</a> from Blake Masters to support his senate ambitions. To be clear, Thiel is a fundamentalist libertarian, and at the very least <a href="https://gizmodo.com/peter-thiel-bitcoin-talk-miami-2022-1848764790" title="">highly eccentric</a>. This is not necessarily a positive for the technology.</p></div>

<div id="Ch6.S2.I1.i6.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S2.I1.i6.p1.1">Virtual worlds are a huge application for NFTs, and this seems like it would be a natural fit for our collaborative mixed reality application. In reality the $2B of sold so far is mostly ‘allocations’ in nascent ecosystems, being sold as highly speculative assets, without even a metaverse to use. The majority of that amount is the hyped ‘Otherland’ plots sold under the Bored Apes brand.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>6.3 </span>Objects in our collaborative mixed reality</h4>
<div id="Ch6.S3.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S3.p1.1">There has been a recent shift away from the ‘toxic’ moniker of NFT and toward ‘Digital objects’, and seem to be judged crucial to metaverse applications. The success of avatar <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/reddit-nft-success-ca2685163576" title="">‘collectibles’ markets</a> in the Reddit ecosystem, and Meta (ex Facebook) similarly divesting themselves of the NFT term seem to suggest a pivot point in the industry. Meta were encouraging adoption through zero fee incentives but were likely hanging their monetisation of their whole rebrand on taking a huge cut from NFT content creators on their platform. This seems to have failed and they are <a href="https://help.instagram.com/1824155514623095" title="">winding up</a> that part of their business.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S3.p2">
<p id="Ch6.S3.p2.1">We have potential paths to digital assets within future layer 3 technologies (<a href="https://www.rgb.tech/" title="">RGB</a> &amp; Pear Credits), but they’re not yet fit for purpose. There are compromise options already available, as below.</p></div>
<section id="Ch6.S3.SS1">
<h5>
<span>6.3.1 </span>Liquid tokens</h5>
<div id="Ch6.S3.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS1.p1.1">We have seen that Liquid from Blockstream is a comparatively mature and battle tested sidechain framework, based upon Bitcoin. It is possible to issue tokens on Liquid, and these have their own hardware wallet available. This makes the technology a strong contender for our uses.</p></div>

<p id="Ch6.S3.SS2.p1.1">While it’s been discounted elsewhere it’s hard to ignore the network effect of Eth NFTs. If the aspiration is to attract the bulk of the ‘legacy’ creator/consumer markets then it will be necessary to support integration of Metamask into any FOSS stack. This isn’t a huge technical challenge, nor is it particularly of interest to our use cases at this stage, but it remains a possibility. The main problems remain the slow speed and high expense of the system.</p></div>

<div id="Ch6.S3.SS3.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS3.p1.1">Solana is both cheap and fast, because it’s very highly centralised. It seems unlikely that it’s worth this level of compromise. It has also become embroiled with the fallout from the enormous FTX exchange fraud, threatening the existence of the assets (NFTs) issued and stored upon it.</p></div>

<p id="Ch6.S3.SS6.p1.1">It feels like spacechains are almost ready, so this is worth keeping an eye on. It’s the ‘cleanest’ way to issue assets using Bitcoin because there’s no additional speculative chain. As briefly explained in the earlier section Bitcoin is destroyed to create a new chain which then inherits the security of Bitcoin through onward mining. This new asset or chain is able to accrue value and trade independently based purely on it’s value to the buyer, not as a function of a wider speculative bubble attached to a token with multiple use cases.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>6.3.8 </span>Satoshi Ordinals</h5>
<div id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p1.1">Ordinals offer a new and innovative way of creating NFTs using bitcoin. The ability to store NFTs on the bitcoin blockchain offers the security, immutability, and decentralization that is fundamental to bitcoin’s design. These are being called ‘ordinal inscriptions’. In addition the use of Taproot has allowed Ordinals to store large files on the bitcoin blockchain, by exploiting cheap space which was designed to add more complex ‘script-path spend’ scripts. Their creator Rodarmor says the following of them: <span id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p1.1.1">“Inscriptions are digital artifacts, and digital artifacts are NFTs, but not all NFTs are digital artifacts. Digital artifacts are NFTs held to a higher standard, closer to their ideal. For an NFT to be a digital artifact, it must be decentralized, immutable, on-chain, and unrestricted. The vast majority of NFTs are not digital artifacts. Their content is stored off-chain and can be lost, they are on centralized chains, and they have back-door admin keys. What’s worse, because they are smart contracts, they must be audited on a case-by-case basis to determine their properties. Inscriptions are unplagued by such flaws. Inscriptions are immutable and on-chain, on the oldest, most decentralized, most secure blockchain in the world. They are not smart contracts, and do not need to be examined individually to determine their properties. They are true digital artifacts.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p2">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p2.1">Ordinals work by individually tracking single satoshis and repurposing them as digital artefacts, using the convention of <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/overview.html" title="">“ordinal theory”</a> to ascribe non-fungible features to the satoshis in a consistent and coherent manner. They can contain various forms of digital content, such as images, audio, video, and pdfs, even <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/6edf80efbbae537b554340c31496439b57bef65357a57f21cbb547bc6287d7bfi0" title="">playable games</a>. The Inscriptions are stored entirely on the bitcoin blockchain, taking advantage of the Taproot upgrade to store the NFT data in Taproot. The bytes remain in the original minted transaction, but the ownership can be passed around by ‘spending’ the UTXO which contained the satoshi forward, not transferring that data, which remains linked to the original ordinal only. There is a <a href="https://ordinals.com/" title="">file explorer for these digital objects</a>. This hardly seems the <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1619836529718996993?" title="">orgy of inefficiency</a> suggested by Adam Back, but there are certainly storage considerations. While this is considered a waste of Bitcoin block space by some, it is possible that the main concern here is the discount that these taproot scripts enjoy, allowing a skewing of the use of money to commit to the chain toward frivolity. The costs associated with committing data to the ledger will likely rise alongside all other operations on the chain, and already represents an unacceptably bar for our requirements, but the innovation is interesting, and the digital artefacts are already being sold for up to £180,000.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p3">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p3.1">It seems right now that the older Bitcoin community is pushing back on the technology as “spamming the blockchain”, <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-September/017306.html" title="">something discussed since 2019</a>. The cost works out around 50k satoshis per 100kbytes of data, which is comparatively reasonable. Our issue with this approach is that richer nations will be able to push out developing economy financial use cases with the more fun, but frivolous data storage and scarcity application.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p4">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p4.1">The narrative seems to be that it’s already pushing up the fees on the network and the overall price of Bitcoin as tens of thousands of minting transactions enter the ecosystem (Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch6.F4" title="Figure 6.4 ‣ 6.3.8 Satoshi Ordinals ‣ 6.3 Objects in our collaborative mixed reality ‣ Chapter 6 Digital Objects &amp; NFTs ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>6.4</span></a>).</p></div>

<div id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p5">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p5.1">In what seems to be a fascinating case study on ownership one ‘Bored Ape’ owner moved coveted their Ethereum NFT by destroying it on the original chain in order to migrate to Bitcoin. Yuga labs stated that this NFT owner had destroyed their asset, giving up any right they might have had. Yuga can now presumably create and sell another copy of this image. It’s fair to say that ownership of digital art is far from a settled matter, as pointed out by Low <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx153" title="">153</a>]</cite>. We do not plan on attaching <span id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p5.1.1">any</span> legal assertions to our use of digital objects at the lowest level. What people do with them will be up to them and the open market. Neither does this exclude users of the open source stack from attempting to attach their own restrictions to IP associated with their work.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p6">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p6.1">There is also likely to be a considerable impact on the size of the <span id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p6.1.1">full</span> Bitcoin blockchain if this approach becomes commonplace. What was a 500 gigabyte file with a fairly linear growth rate will likely become many terabytes over the coming years. The overall workaround for this would be ‘pruned nodes’ vs ‘archival nodes’, similar to the Ethereum approach, with those likely only run in places where prosecutions for illegal data on the chain seem unlikely. Curiously this won’t effect users of the system who choose to run their own nodes, as the software is configured to throw away this extraneous data prior to the timestamp of the last software upgrade. Concerns that this might price out participation from emerging markets are overblown from an infrastructure point of view, but potentially valid from a fee competition standpoint. This perhaps drives Lightning adoption. Nobody seems too sure, though Kaloudis, senior researcher at Coindesk describes the tradeoffs and tensions at this time <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx154" title="">154</a>]</cite>. As seems to be the norm now, there is <a href="https://nosft.xyz/" title="">Nostr integration</a> coming to Ordinals.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p7">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p7.1">The recent announcement by Yuga Labs, the team behind the popular NFT collection Board Ape Yacht Club and the stewards of CryptoPunks, that they are getting into the ordinals space with their new collection, 12-Fold, has generated a lot of reactions from the crypto community. This move is variously seen as significant highlighting the potential for Bitcoin-based NFTs, or just a naked cash grab. Yuga are at pains to point out the ownership and self-custody aspects, which are fundamental principles of Bitcoin and better than their current product lines.</p></div>
<div id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p8">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p8.1">As a small technical aside, the move towards inscriptions and ordinals has also led to a surge in interest in partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBT), which allows multiple people to use Bitcoin collaboratively. This is an important standard for multi-sig agreements and more, and facilitates the secure transfer of the ordinals, giving them a huge boost. The blossoming of Noster and inscriptions at the same time is seen as a sign that the theoretical usefulness of Bitcoin infrastructure is now actually being built at pace.</p></div>

<div id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p10">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS8.p10.1">This is obviously far too expensive for the bulk of our use cases within the metaverse, and we will use RGB for this in the end (as we have always intended). Ukolova, the director of the board for LNP/BP Standards Association which develops the RGB protocol and product stack <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/are-ordinals-really-good-for-bitcoin" title="">wrote an opinion piece</a> on Ordinals which is worth finishing on. The article discusses the limitations of using Ordinals in the context of Bitcoin, particularly with regards to privacy, scalability, and technical difficulties. While Ordinals may offer a unique way to represent ownership of rare and expensive assets, they do not provide additional privacy features beyond what is already offered by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous nature. RGB puts all of the data of the asset on the client side, ensuring peer-to-peer verification without relying on any third parties or miners. The protocol also applies zero-knowledge cryptographic primitives such as bulletproofs to bring privacy to holders and creators.</p></div>

<h6>BRC-20</h6>
<div id="Ch6.S3.SS8.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS8.SSSx1.p1.1">BRC-20 tokens are fungible tokens that are created by attaching a JSON to satoshis through Bitcoin ordinals. The JSON code bit defines every characteristic of the BRC-20 token including the minting, and distribution, the bitcoin network decodes this information once they are deployed. BRC-20 tokens are minted and spent like normal tokens. BRC-20 tokens utilize Ordinals inscriptions of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data to deploy token contracts, mint, and transfer tokens. Currently, the BRC-20 token standard allows creating a BRC-20 token with the deploy function, minting an amount of BRC-20 tokens with the mint function, and transferring an amount of BRC-20 tokens via the transfer function. It’s notable that for purely fungible assets that don’t require smart contract functionality (which is most of them) BRC-20 is superior to Ethereum’s ERC-20 in simplicity, security, and the fairness of the minting process. The community seems very split on this use of the chain, and it’s impact on transaction fee markets.</p></div>

<div id="Ch6.S3.SS8.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch6.S3.SS8.SSSx2.p1.1">It is also possible to use the whole suit of ordinal based ideas on any other chain such as Litecoin, the long standing Bitcoin fork which is used somewhat as a technical testbed for Bitcoin. This might develop into a far more appealing option, though again, it’s too early to be sure.</p></div>

Hopefully it’s clear to the reader that this kind of development guides the work here. In the wider “real-time social VR” various companies have attempted to build closed ecosystems, for years. These now look more like attempts at digital society, but are closer to isolated metaverses, or more usefully isolated digital ecosystems. This is still happening. There’s every chance that when Apple make their augmented reality play this year or next they will keep their system closed off as this tends to be their business model. Theo Priestly, CEO at Metanomics <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6977366421034967040/" title="">points out</a> that Chinese Giant Tencent are doing similar, and he cited Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch7.F1" title="Figure 7.1 ‣ 7.1 Toward an open metaverse ‣ Chapter 7 Collaborative mixed reality ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>7.1</span></a>; building a closed but tightly linked suite of businesses into something that looks like a metaverse.

The text below encapsulates much of the reasoning that led to this book and product exploration, and is paraphrased <a href="https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1536046831045685248" title="">from this thread</a> for our purposes.</p></div>

<p id="Ch7.S1.p3.1"><span id="Ch7.S1.p3.1.1">Bit by bit, the visualization layer of the internet will get better until it is unrecognisably better (+/- 10 years). As the visualization layer of the internet gets better, digital objects will become more useful and more important. Avatars (2D and 3D), art, schoolwork, work work, 3D virtual spaces and hundreds of other things. Not only will the objects themselves become more important, they will lead to different emergent behaviours. We see this already with avatars and mixed eponymous/pseudonymous/anonymous communities. Yes, it is the internet plumbing underneath, but just like social media changed human behaviour on the internet, metaverse type experiences will further change it. NFT Twitter + Discord + various virtual worlds is a form of early metaverse. I feel like I am entering a different world here, not just some websites. The most important question for the health of the internet/metaverse/human society in the 2030s will be decided now. And that question is: "who stores the definitive ownership records of those digital objects". There are two answers: a company’s database OR a blockchain. If we end up with "a company’s database" we will end up with all the web dysfunctions, but worse. SMTP is an open protocol that anyone can use so we don’t have societal level fights on "who is allowed to use email". Short messaging online ended up becoming Twitter. So we end up having the most absurd, surreal discussions on the topic of "who is allowed to use short-messaging" being dependant on "who is the CEO of Twitter". There is no way this is the correct architecture for our progressively more digital economy…. If this is your first time around here, we are fighting for an open metaverse.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S1.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S1.p4.1">It seems that industry shares much of this opinion regarding an open metaverse. The proposal of a persistent interactive digital universe online is <span id="Ch7.S1.p4.1.1">so</span> vast that major players recognise that they will not be able to monopolise this space, though Facebook/Meta are clearly attempting to. The <a href="https://metaverse-standards.org/news/press-releases/leading-standards-organizations-and-companies-unite-to-drive-open-metaverse-interoperability/" title="">Metaverse Standards Forum</a> is clearly an attempt by the other industry players to catch up and then get out ahead of Meta in this regard. It’s also possible to view this as just another land grab, but through the vehicle of a standards body. Time will tell. They say:</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S1.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S1.p5.1"><span id="Ch7.S1.p5.1.1">“Announced today, The Metaverse Standards Forum brings together leading standards organizations and companies for industry-wide cooperation on interoperability standards needed to build the open metaverse. The Forum will explore where the lack of interoperability is holding back metaverse deployment and how the work of Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) defining and evolving needed standards may be coordinated and accelerated. Open to any organization at no cost, the Forum will focus on pragmatic, action-based projects such as implementation prototyping, hackathons, plugfests, and open-source tooling to accelerate the testing and adoption of metaverse standards, while also developing consistent terminology and deployment guidelines.”</span></p></div>

<h4>
<span>7.2 </span>History</h4>
<div id="Ch7.S2.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S2.p1.1">The word metaverse was coined by the author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snowcrash. It started popping up soon after in <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14819994-000-how-to-build-a-metaverse/" title="">news articles</a> and research papers <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx158" title="">158</a>]</cite>, but in the last five years it has been finding a new life within a silicon valley narrative. Perhaps in response to this Stephenson is now working with a company called <a href="https://www.lamina1.com/" title="">Lamina1</a> which actually looks a lot like the rest of this book, so perhaps we have been on the right track.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S2.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S2.p2.1">There were clear precursors to modern social VR, such as <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/778554/remembering-vrml-the-metaverse-of-1995/" title="">VRML in the 1990’s</a> which laid much of the groundwork for 3D content over networked computers.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S2.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S2.p3.1">It might seem that there would be a clear path from there to now, in terms of a metaverse increasingly meaning connected social virtual spaces, but this has not happened. Instead interest in metaverse as a concept waned, MMORG (described later) filled in the utility, and then recently an entirely new definition emerged. Park and Kim surveyed dozens of different historical interpretations of the word, and the generational reboot they describe makes it even less clear <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx159" title="">159</a>]</cite>. The concept of the Metaverse is extremely plastic at this time (Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch7.F2" title="Figure 7.2 ‣ 7.2 History ‣ Chapter 7 Collaborative mixed reality ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>7.2</span></a>).</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S2.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S2.p4.1">It’s arguable that what will be expanding in this chapter is more appropriately ‘Cyberspace’ as described by William Gibson in Neuromancer <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx160" title="">160</a>]</cite> <span id="Ch7.S2.p4.1.1">“A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S2.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S2.p5.1">Park and Kim identify the generational inflection point which has led to the resurgence of the concept of Metaverse <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx159" title="">159</a>]</cite>:
<span id="Ch7.S2.p5.1.1">“Unlike previous studies on the Metaverse based on Second Life, the current Metaverse is based on the social value of Generation Z that online and offine selves are not different.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S2.p6">
<p id="Ch7.S2.p6.1">Brett Leonard, writer director of Lawnmower Man talks about the pressing need to get out in front of moral questions in the development of metaverse applications. He stressed that wellbeing will be a crucial underpinning of the technology because of the inherent intimacy of immersion in virtual spaces. He suggests that emotional engagement with storied characters is needed to satisfy the human need for narrative, and that this should be utopian by design to stave off the worst of dystopian emergent characteristics of the technology.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S2.p7">
<p id="Ch7.S2.p7.1">The book will aim to build toward an understanding of metaverse as a useful social mixed reality, that allows low friction communication and economic activity, within groups, at a global scale. Cryptography and distributed software can assist us with globally ‘true’ persistence of digital data, so we will look to integrate this with our social XR. This focus on persistence, value, and trust means it’s most appropriate to focus on business uses as there is more opportunity for value creation which will be important to bootstrap this technology.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S2.p8">
<p id="Ch7.S2.p8.1">Elsewhere in the book we state that metaverse is the worst of the tele-collaboration tool-kits, and in general we ‘believe’ this to be true at this time. With that said Hennig-Thurau says the following in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7020679507141361664/" title="">LinkedIn post</a>: <span id="Ch7.S2.p8.1.1">Our research finds that the performance of social interactions in the VR metaverse varies for different outcomes and settings, with productivity and creativity being on par with Zoom (not higher, but also not lower) for the two experimental settings in which we studied these constructs. Thus, as of today, meeting in VR does not overcome all the limitations that we are facing when using Zoom or Teams. But most importantly (to us), we find clear evidence that when people get together in the metaverse via VR, it creates SUBSTANTIALLY higher levels of social presence among group members across ALL FIVE STUDY CONTEXTS, from idea generation to joint movie going. This is the main insight from our study and the stuff we believe future uses of social virtual reality can (and should) build on. We also explain that the effectiveness of VR meetings can be further increased, and also how this can be done (by selecting the most appropriate settings, people, avatars, hardware, environments etc.).</span> <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx161" title="">161</a>]</cite></p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S2.p9">
<p id="Ch7.S2.p9.1">We agree that with sufficiently informed guiding constraints in place, and smaller group sizes (ie, not a large scale social metaverse), that there is a path forward.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S2.p10">
<p id="Ch7.S2.p10.1">This chapter will first attempt to frame the context for telepresence (the academic term for communicating through technology), and then explain the increasingly polarised options for metaverse. It’s useful to precisely identify the primitives of the product we would like to see here, so this chapter is far more a review of academic literature in the field, culminating in a proposed framework.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>7.3 </span>Video conferencing, the status quo</h4>
<div id="Ch7.S3.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S3.p1.1">This section has been adapted and updated for open source release, from the authors PhD thesis, with the permission of the University of Salford.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S3.p2.1">Video-conferencing has become more popular as technology improves, as it gets better integrated with ubiquitous cloud business support suites, and as a function of the global pandemic and changing work patterns. There is obviously increasing demands for real-time communication across greater distances.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S3.p3.1">The full effects of video-conferencing on human communication are still being explored, as seen in the experimental <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/microsoft-teams-together-mode/" title="">“Together Mode”</a> within Microsoft Teams. Video-conferencing is presumed to be a somewhat richer form of communication than email and telephone, but not quite as informative as face-to-face communication.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S3.p4.1">In this section we look at the influence of eye contact on communication and how video-conferencing mediates both verbal and non-verbal interactions. Facilitation of eye contact is a challenge that must be addressed so that video-conferencing can approach the rich interactions of face-to-face communication. This is an even bigger problem in the emerging metaverse systems, so it’s important that we examine the history and trajectory.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S3.p5.1">There is a tension emerging for companies who do not necessarily need to employ remote meeting technology, but also cannot afford to ignore the competitive advantages that such systems bring. In an experiment preformed well before the 2020 global pandemic at CTrip, Bloom et al describe how home working led to a 13% performance increase, of which about 9% was from working more minutes per shift (fewer breaks and sick-days) and 4% from more calls per minute (attributed to a quieter working environment) <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx162" title="">162</a>]</cite>. Home workers also reported improved work satisfaction and experienced less turnover, but their promotion rate conditional on performance fell. This speaks to a lack of management capability with such systemic change. It’s clearly a complex and still barely understood change within business and management.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.p6">
<p id="Ch7.S3.p6.1">Due to the success of the experiment, CTrip rolled-out the option to work from home to the whole company, and allowed the experimental employees to re-select between the home or office. Interestingly, over half of them switched, which led to the gains almost doubling to 22%. This highlights the benefits of learning and selection effects when adopting modern management practices like working from home. Increasingly this is becoming a choice issue for prospective employees, and an advantage for hiring managers to be able to offer it.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.p7">
<p id="Ch7.S3.p7.1">More recent research by Barrero, Bloom and Davies found that working from home is likely to be “sticky” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx163" title="">163</a>]</cite>. They found:</p><ul id="Ch7.S3.I1">

<p id="Ch7.S3.p7.2">More recently Enterprise Collaboration Systems (ECS) provide rich document management, sharing, and collaboration functionality across an organisation. The enterprise ECS system may integrate collaborative video <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx164" title="">164</a>]</cite>. This is for instance the case with Microsoft Teams / Sharepoint. This integration of ECS should be considered when thinking about social VR systems which wish to support business, value, and trust. It is very much the case that large technology providers are attempting to integrate their ‘business back end’ systems into their emerging metaverse systems. Open source equivalents are currently lacking.</p></div>

<div id="Ch7.S3.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS1.p1.1">The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic is <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/news/the-future-of-work-is-remote/" title="">changing how people work</a>, toward a new global ‘normal’. Some ways of working are overdue transformation, and will be naturally disrupted. In the UK at least it seems that there may be real appetite to shift away from old practises. This upheaval will inevitably present both challenges and opportunities.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS1.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS1.p2.1">Highly technical workforces, especially, can <a href="https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics" title="">operate from anywhere</a>. The post pandemic world seems to have stronger national border controls, with a resultant shortage of highly technical staff. This has forced the hand of global business toward <a href="https://www.lifeatspotify.com/being-here/work-from-anywhere" title="">internationally distributed teams</a>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS1.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS1.p3.1">If only a small percentage of companies allow the option of remote working, then they gain a structural advantage, enjoying benefits of reduced travel, lower workplace infection risk across all disease, and global agility for the personnel. Building and estate costs will certainly be reduced. More diversity may be possible. Issues such as sexual harassment and bullying may be reduced. With reduced overheads product quality may increase. If customers are happier with their services, then over time this ‘push’ may mean an enormous shift away from centralised working practises toward distributed working.</p></div>

<p id="Ch7.S3.SS1.p4.1">Technologies which support this working style were still in their infancy at the beginning of the pandemic.

<div id="Ch7.S3.SS2.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS2.p1.1">O’Malley et al. showed that face-to-face and video mediated employed visual cues for mutual understanding, and that addition of video to the audio channel aided confidence and mutual understanding. However, video mediated did not provide the clear cues of being co-located <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx168" title="">168</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS2.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS2.p2.1">Dourish et al. make a case for not using face-to-face as a baseline for comparison, but rather that analysis of the efficacy of remote tele-collaboration tools should be made in a wider context of connected multimedia tools and ‘emergent communicative practises’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx169" title="">169</a>]</cite>.

Roberts et al. suggested that at the limit of social gaze distance (&nbsp;4m) the maximum angular separation between people standing shoulder to shoulder in the real world would be around 4 degrees<cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx173" title="">173</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<div id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p1.1">Early enthusiasm in the 1970’s for video conferencing, as a medium for small group interaction quickly turned to disillusionment. It was agreed after a flurry of initial research that the systems at the time offered no particular advantage over audio only communication, and at considerable cost <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx179" title="">179</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p2.1">Something in the breakdown of normal visual cues seems to impact the ability of the technology to support flowing group interaction. Nonetheless, some non-verbal communication is supported in VC with limited success.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p3.1">Additional screens and cameras can partially overcome the limitation of no multi-party support (that of addressing a room full of people on a single screen) by making available more bidirectional channels. For instance, every remote user can be a head on a screen with a corresponding camera. The positioning of the screens must then necessarily match the physical organization of the remote room.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p4.1">Egido provides an early review of the failure of VC for group activity, with the “misrepresentation of the technology as a substitute for face-to-face" still being valid today <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx180" title="">180</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p5.1">Commercial systems such as Cisco Telepresence Rooms cluster their cameras above the centre screen of three for meetings using their telecollaboration product, while admitting that this only works well for the central seat of the three screens. They also group multiple people on a single screen in what Workhoven et al. dub a “non-isotropic" configuration <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx181" title="">181</a>]</cite>. They maintain that this is a suitable trade off as the focus of the meeting is more generally toward the important contributor in the central seat. This does not necessarily follow for less formal meeting paradigms.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p6">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS3.p6.1">In small groups, it is more difficult to align non-verbal cues between all parties, and at the same time, it is more important because the hand-offs between parties are more numerous and important in groups. A breakdown in conversational flow in such circumstances is harder to solve. A perception of the next person to talk must be resolved for all parties and agreed upon to some extent.</p></div>

<p id="Ch7.S3.SS4.p1.1">There have been many attempts to support group working and rich data sharing between dispersed groups in a business setting. So called ’smart spaces’ allow interaction with different displays for different activities and add in some ability to communicate with remote or even mobile collaborators on shared documents <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx182" title="">182</a>]</cite>, with additional challenges for multi-disciplinary groups who are perhaps less familiar with one or more of the technology barriers involved <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx183" title="">183</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<span>7.3.5 </span>Mona Lisa Type Effects</h5>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS5.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS5.p1.1">Almost all traditional group video meeting tools suffer from the so-called Mona Lisa effect which describes the phenomenon where the apparent gaze of a portrait or 2 dimensional image always appears to look at the observer regardless of the observer’s position <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx185" title="">185</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx186" title="">186</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx187" title="">187</a>]</cite>. This situation manifests when the painted or imaged subject is looking into the camera or at the eyes of the painter <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx188" title="">188</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx189" title="">189</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS5.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS5.p2.1">Single user-to-user systems based around bidirectional video implicitly align the user’s gaze by constraining the camera to roughly the same location as the display. When viewed away from this ideal axis, it creates the feeling of being looked at regardless of where this observer is <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx190" title="">190</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx185" title="">185</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx186" title="">186</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx187" title="">187</a>]</cite>, or the “collapsed view effect” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx191" title="">191</a>]</cite> where perception of gaze transmitted from a 2 dimensional image or video is dependent on the incidence of originating gaze to the transmission medium.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS5.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS5.p3.1">Multiple individuals using one such channel can feel as if they are being looked at simultaneously, leading to a breakdown in the normal non-verbal communication which mediates turn passing <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx192" title="">192</a>]</cite>.
There is research investigating this sensitivity when the gaze is mediated by a technology, finding that “disparity between the optical axis of the camera and the looking direction of a looker should be at most 1.2 degrees in the horizontal direction, and 1.7 degrees in vertical direction to support eye contact" <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx171" title="">171</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx193" title="">193</a>]</cite>. It seems that humans assume that they are being looked at unless they are sure that they are not <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx172" title="">172</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS5.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS5.p4.1">To be clear, there are technological solutions to this problem, but it’s useful in the context of discussing metaverse to know that this problem exists. It’s known that there are cognitive dissonances around panes of video conference images, but it seems that the effect is truely limited to 2D surfaces. A 3D projection surface (a physical model of a human) designed to address this problem completely removed the Mona Lisa effect <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx190" title="">190</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S3.SS5.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S3.SS5.p5.1">Metaverse then perhaps offers the promise of solving this, making more natural interaction possible, but it’s clearly a long way from delivering on those promises right now. We need to understand what’s important and try to map these into a metaverse product.</p></div>

<p id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p4.2">Additional to the semantic content of verbal communication there is a rich layer of meaning in pauses, gaps, and overlaps <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx197" title="">197</a>]</cite> which help to mediate who is speaking and who is listening in multi-party conversation. This mediation of turn passing, to facilitate flow, is by no means a given and is highly dependent on context and other factors <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx198" title="">198</a>]</cite>. Interruptions are also a major factor in turn passing.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p5.1">This extra-verbal content <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx199" title="">199</a>]</cite> extends into physical cues, so-called ‘nonverbal’ cues, and there are utterances which link the verbal and non-verbal <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx200" title="">200</a>]</cite>. This will be discussed later, but to an extent, it is impossible to discuss verbal communication without regard to the implicit support which exists around the words themselves.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p6">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p6.1">In the context of all technology-mediated conversation the extra-verbal is easily compromised if technology used to support communication over a distance does not convey the information, or conveys it badly. This can introduce additional complexity <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx200" title="">200</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p7">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p7.1">These support structures are pretty much lacking in metaverse XR systems. The goal then here perhaps is to examine the state-of-the-art, and remove as many of the known barriers as possible. Such a process might better support trust, which might better support the kind of economic and activity we seek to engineer.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p8">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p8.1">When examining just verbal / audio communication technology it can be assumed that the physical non-verbal cues are lost, though not necessarily unused. In the absence of non-verbal cues it falls to timely vocal signals to take up the slack when framing and organising the turn passing. For the synchronising of vocal signals between the parties to be effective the systemic delays must remain small. System latency, the inherent delays added by the communication technology, can allow slips or a complete breakdown of ’flow’ <cite>[<span>katagiri2007aiduti</span>]</cite>. This problem can be felt in current social VR platforms, though people don’t necessarily identify the cause of the breakdown correctly. In the main they feel to the users like a bad “audio-only” teleconference.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p9">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p9.1">With that said, the transmission of verbal / audio remains the most critical element for interpersonal communication as the most essential meaning is encoded semantically. There is a debate about ratios of how much information is conveyed through the various human channels <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx201" title="">201</a>]</cite>, but it is reasonable to infer from its ubiquity that support for audio is essential for meaningful communication over a distance. We have seen that it must be timely, to prevent a breakdown of framing, and preferably have sufficient fidelity to convey sub-vocal utterances.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p10">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS1.p10.1">For social immersive VR for business users, a real-time network such as websockets, RTP, or UDP seems essential, much better microphones are important, and the system should support both angular spatialisation, and respond to distance between interlocutors.</p></div>

<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.p1.1">We have already seen that verbal exchanges take place in a wider context of sub vocal and physical cues.

<h6>Gaze</h6>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p1.1">Of particular importance is judgement of eye gaze which is normally fast, accurate and automatic, operating at multiple levels of cognition through multiple cues <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx196" title="">196</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx204" title="">204</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx205" title="">205</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx204" title="">204</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx206" title="">206</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx207" title="">207</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx176" title="">176</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p2.1">Gaze in particular aids smooth turn passing <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx208" title="">208</a>]</cite> <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx209" title="">209</a>]</cite> and lack of support for eye gaze has been found to decrease the efficiency of turn passing by 25% <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx210" title="">210</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p3.1">There are clear patterns to eye gaze in groups, with the person talking, or being talked to, probably also being looked at <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx211" title="">211</a>]</cite> <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx212" title="">212</a>]</cite>. To facilitate this groups will tend to position themselves to maximally enable observation of the gaze of the other parties <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx207" title="">207</a>]</cite>. This intersects with proxemics which will be discussed shortly. In general people look most when they are listening, with short glances of 3-10 seconds <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx205" title="">205</a>]</cite>. Colburn et al. suggest that gaze direction and the perception of the gaze of others directly impacts social cognition <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx213" title="">213</a>]</cite> and this has been supported in a follow up study <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx214" title="">214</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p4.1">The importance of gaze is clearly so significant in evolutionary terms that human acuity for eye direction is considered high at &nbsp;30 sec arc <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx215" title="">215</a>]</cite> with straight binocular gaze judged more accurately than straight monocular gaze <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx216" title="">216</a>]</cite>, when using stereo vision.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p5.1">Regarding the judgement of the gaze of others, Symons et al. suggested that “people are remarkably sensitive to shifts in a person’s eye gaze” in triadic conversation <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx215" title="">215</a>]</cite>.
This perception of the gaze of others operates at a low level and is automatic. Langton et al. cite research stating that the gaze of others is “able to trigger reflexive shifts of an observer’s visual attention” and further discuss the deep biological underpinnings of gaze processing <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx212" title="">212</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p6">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p6.1">When discussing technology-mediated systems, Vertegaal &amp; Ding suggested that understanding the effects of gaze on triadic conversation is “crucial for the design of teleconferencing systems and collaborative virtual environments” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx192" title="">192</a>]</cite>, and further found correlation between the amount of gaze, and amount of speech. Vertegaal &amp; Slagter suggest that “gaze function(s) as an indicator of conversational attention in multiparty conversations” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx211" title="">211</a>]</cite>. It seems like is we are to have useful markets within social immersive environments then support for natural gaze effects should be a priority.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p7">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p7.1">Wilson et al. found that subjects can “discriminate gaze focused on adjacent faces up to [3.5m]” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx217" title="">217</a>]</cite>. This perhaps gives us a testable benchmark within a metaverse application which is eye gaze enabled. In this regard Schrammel et al. investigated to what extent embodied agents can elicit the same responses in eye gaze detection <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx218" title="">218</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p8">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p8.1">Vertegaal et al. found that task performace was 46% better when gaze was synchronised in their telepresence scenario. As they point out, gaze synchonisation (temporal and spatial) is ‘commendable’ in all such group situations, but the precise utility will depend upon the task <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx192" title="">192</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p9">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p9.1">There has been some success in the automatic detection of the focus of attention of participants in multi party meetings <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx219" title="">219</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx220" title="">220</a>]</cite>. More recently, eye tracking technologies allow the recording and replaying of accurate eye gaze information <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx221" title="">221</a>]</cite> alongside information about pupil dilation toward determination of honesty and social presence <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx222" title="">222</a>]</cite>. It seems there are trust and honesty issues conflated with how collaborants in a virtual space are represented.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p10">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx1.p10.1">In summary, gaze awareness does not just mediate verbal communication but rather is a complex channel of communication in its own right. Importantly, gaze has a controlling impact on those who are involved in the communication at any one time, including and excluding even beyond the current participants. Perhaps the systems we propose in this book need to demand eye gaze support, but it is clear that it should be recommended, and that the software selected should support the technology integration in principle.</p></div>

<h6>Mutual Gaze</h6>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p1.1">Aygyle and Cook established early work around gaze and mutual gaze, with their seminal book of the same title <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx204" title="">204</a>]</cite>, additionally detailing confounding factors around limitations and inaccuracies in observance of gaze and how this varies with distance <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx206" title="">206</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx196" title="">196</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx223" title="">223</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p2.1">Mutual gaze is considered to be the most sophisticated form of gaze awareness with significant impact on dyadic conversation especially <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx223" title="">223</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx198" title="">198</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx224" title="">224</a>]</cite>. The effects seem more profound than just helping to mediate flow and attention, with mutual eye gaze aiding in memory recall and the formation of impressions <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx225" title="">225</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p3.1">While reconnection of mutual eye gaze through a technology boundary does not seem completely necessary it is potentially important, with impact on subtle elements of one-to-one communication, and therefore discrimination of eye gaze direction should be bi-directional if possible, and if possible have sufficient accuracy to judge direct eye contact. In their review Bohannon et al. said that the issue of rejoining eye contact must be addressed in order to fully realise the richness of simulating face-to-face encounters <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx225" title="">225</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx2.p4.1">Mutual gaze is a challenging affordance as bi-directional connection of gaze is not a trivial problem. It’s perhaps best to view this as at the ‘edge’ of our requirements for a metaverse.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx3">
<h6>Mutual Gaze in Telepresence</h6>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx3.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx3.p1.1">We have seen that transmission of attention can broadly impact communication in subtle ways, impacting empathy, trust, cognition, and co-working patterns. Mutual gaze (looking into one another’s eyes), is currently the high water mark for technology-mediated conversation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx3.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx3.p2.1">Many attempts have been made to re-unite mutual eye gaze when using tele-conferencing systems. In their 2015 review of approaches Regenbrecht and Langlotz found that none of the methods they examined were completely ideal <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx226" title="">226</a>]</cite>. They found most promise in 2D and 3D interpolation techniques, which will be discussed in detail later, but they opined that such systems were very much ongoing research and lacked sufficient optimisation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx3.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx3.p3.1">A popular approach uses the so called ’Peppers Ghost’ phenomenon <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx227" title="">227</a>]</cite>, where a semi silvered mirror presents an image to the eye of the observer, but allows a camera to view through from behind the angled mirror surface. The earliest example of this is Rosental’s two way television system in 1947 <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx228" title="">228</a>]</cite>, though Buxton et al. ‘Reciprocal Video Tunnel’ from 1992 is more often cited <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx229" title="">229</a>]</cite>. This optical characteristic isn’t supported by retroreflective projection technology, and besides requires careful control of light levels either side of the semi-silvered surface.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx3.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx3.p4.1">The early GAZE-2 system (which makes use of Pepper’s ghost) is novel in that it uses an eye tracker to select the correct camera from several trained on the remote user. This ensures that the correct returned gaze (within the ability of the system) is returned to the correct user on the other end of the network <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx230" title="">230</a>]</cite>.
Mutual gaze capability is later highlighted as an affordance supported or unsupported by key research and commercial systems.</p></div>

<h6>Head Orientation</h6>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p1.1">Orientation of the head (judged by the breaking of bilateral symmetry and alignment of nose) is a key factor when judging attention. Perception of head orientation can be judged to within a couple of degrees <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx217" title="">217</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p2.1">It has been established that head gaze can be detected all the way out to the extremis of peripheral vision, with accurate eye gaze assessment only achievable in central vision <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx188" title="">188</a>]</cite>. This is less of use for our metaverses at this time, because user field of view is almost always restricted in such systems. More usefully, features of illumination can alter the apparent orientation of the head <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx231" title="">231</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p3.1">Head motion over head orientation is a more nuanced propostion and can be considered a micro gesture <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx232" title="">232</a>]</cite>. Head tracking systems within head mounted displays can certainly detect these tiny movements, but it’s clear that not all of this resolution is passed into shared virtual settings through avatars. It would be beneficial to be able to fine tune this feature within any software selected.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p4.1">It is possible that 3D displays are better suited to perception of head gaze since it is suggested that they are more suitable for “shape understanding tasks” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx233" title="">233</a>]</cite></p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p5.1">Bailenson, Baell, and Blascovich found that giving avatars rendered head movements in a shared virtual environment decreased the amount of talking, possibly as the extra channel of head gaze was opened up. They also reported that subjectively, communication was enhanced <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx234" title="">234</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p6">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx4.p6.1">Clearly head orientation is an important indicator of the direction of attention of members of a group and can be discerned even in peripheral vision. This allows the focus of several parties to be followed simultaneously and is an important affordance to replicate on any multi-party communication system.</p></div>

<h6>Combined Head and Eye Gaze</h6>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx5.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx5.p1.1">Rienks et al. found that head orientation alone does not provide a reliable cue for identification of the speaker in a multiparty setting <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx235" title="">235</a>]</cite>. Stiefelhagen &amp; Zhu found “that head orientation contributes 68.9% to the overall gaze direction on average” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx220" title="">220</a>]</cite>, though head and eye gaze seem to be judged interdependently <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx216" title="">216</a>]</cite>. Langton noted that head and eye gaze are “mutually influential in the analysis of social attention” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx212" title="">212</a>]</cite>, and it is clear that transmission of ‘head gaze’ by any mediating system, enhances rather than replaces timely detection of subtle cues. Combined head and eye gaze give the best of both worlds and extend the lateral field of view in which attention can be reliably conveyed to others <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx188" title="">188</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

Goldin-Meadow suggests that gesturing aids conversational flow by resolving mismatches and aiding cognition <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx238" title="">238</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx6.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S4.SS2.SSSx6.p2.1">In their technology-mediated experiment which compared face to upper body and face on a flat screen, Nguyen and Canny found that “upper-body framing improves empathy measures and gives results not significantly different from face-to-face under several empathy measures” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx236" title="">236</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<br></span>Much emotional context can be described by facial expression (display) alone <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx237" title="">237</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx239" title="">239</a>]</cite>, with smooth transition between expressions seemingly important <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx240" title="">240</a>]</cite>. This suggests that mediating technologies should support high temporal resolution, or at least that there is a minimum resolution between which transitions between expressions become too ’categorical’. Some aspects of conversational flow appear to be mediated in part by facial expression <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx241" title="">241</a>]</cite>.

These are clearly important cues. Kleinsmith and Bianchi-Berthouze assert that "some affective expressions may be better communicated by the body than the face" <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx245" title="">245</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

Tuddenham et al. found that co-located collaborators naturally devolved ’territory’ of working when sharing a task space, and that this did not happen the same way with a tele-present collaborator <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx255" title="">255</a>]</cite>.

<div id="Ch7.S5.SS2.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S5.SS2.p1.1">The study of attention is a discrete branch of psychology. It is the study of cognitive selection toward a subjective or objective sub focus, to the relative exclusion of other stimulae. It has been defined as “a range of neural operations that selectively enhance processing of information” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx268" title="">268</a>]</cite>. In the context of interpersonal communication it can be refined to apply to selectively favouring a conversational agent or object or task above other stimuli in the contextual frame.</p></div>

When new relationships are formed the “primary concern is one of uncertainty reduction or increasing predictability about the behaviour of both themselves and others in the interaction” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx276" title="">276</a>]</cite>. This concept of smoothness in the conversation is a recurring theme, with better engineered systems introducing less extraneous artefacts into the communication, and so disturbing the flow less. Immersive metaverse are rife with artefacts.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S5.SS3.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S5.SS3.p2.1">In a similar vein the actor-observer effect describes the mismatch between expectations which can creep into conversation.

<div id="Ch7.S5.SS4.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S5.SS4.p1.1">Presence is a heavily cited historic indicator of engagement in virtual reality, though the precise meaning has been interpreted differently by different specialisms <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx290" title="">290</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx291" title="">291</a>]</cite>. It is generally agreed to be the ’sense of being’ in a virtual environment <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx292" title="">292</a>]</cite>.

<p id="Ch7.S5.SS4.p3.1">When presence is applied to interaction it may be split into Telepresence, and Co/Social presence <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx293" title="">293</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx294" title="">294</a>]</cite>. Co-presence and/or social presence is the sense of “being there with another", and describes the automatic responses to complex social cues <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx295" title="">295</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx296" title="">296</a>]</cite>. Social presence (and co-presence) refers in this research context to social presence which is mediated by technology (even extending to text based chat <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx297" title="">297</a>]</cite>), and has its foundations in psychological mechanisms which engender mutualism in the ‘real’. This is analysed in depth by Nowak <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx298" title="">298</a>]</cite>. An examination of telepresence, co-presence and social presence necessarily revisits some of the knowledge already elaborated.</p></div>

They suggest a solid understanding of the surrounding psychological requirements which need support in a mediated setting, and then a scope that is detailed and limited to the mediated situation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S5.SS4.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S5.SS4.p5.1">Since ‘social presence’ has been subject to varied definitions <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx300" title="">300</a>]</cite> it is useful here to consider a single definition from the literature which defines it as “the ability of participants in the community of inquiry to project their personal characteristics into the community, thereby presenting themselves to the other participants as real people.” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx301" title="">301</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx290" title="">290</a>]</cite>. Similarly to specifically define co-presence for this research it is taken to be the degree to which participants in a virtual environment are “accesible, available, and subject to one another" <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx300" title="">300</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S5.SS4.p6">
<p id="Ch7.S5.SS4.p6.1">Social presence has received much attention and there are established questionnaires used in the field for measurement of the levels of perceived social presence yet the definitions here also remain broad, with some confusion about what is being measured <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx300" title="">300</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<div id="Ch7.S5.SS4.p9">
<p id="Ch7.S5.SS4.p9.1">The idea of social presence as an indicator of the efficacy of the system, suggests the use of social presence questionnaires in the evaluation of the system <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx300" title="">300</a>]</cite>. Subjective questionnaires are however troublesome in measuring effectiveness of virtual agents and embodiments, with even nonsensical questions producing seemingly valid results <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx303" title="">303</a>]</cite>. Usoh et al. found that ’the real’ produced only marginally higher presence results than the virtual <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx304" title="">304</a>]</cite>.

<p id="Ch7.S5.SS4.p10.1">Nowak states that “A satisfactory level of co-presence with another mind can be achieved with conscious awareness that the interaction is mediated" and asserts that while the mediation may influence the degree of co-presence it is not a prohibiting factor <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx298" title="">298</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

Hauber et al. employed the “Networked Minds" Social Presence questionnaire experimentally and found that while the measure could successfully discriminate between triadic conversation that is mediated or unmediated by technology, it could not find a difference between 2D and 3D mediated interfaces <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx307" title="">307</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx297" title="">297</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

Use of the term in literature peaked between 1999 and 2006 according to Google’s ngram viewer and has been slowly falling off since. The questionnaire methodology has been challenged in recent research and while more objective measurement may be appropriate, the networked minds questions seem to be able to differentiate real from virtual interactions <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx306" title="">306</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<span>7.6 </span>Other Systems to Support Business</h4>
<div id="Ch7.S6.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S6.p1.1">There have been many attempts to support group working and rich data sharing between dispersed groups in a business setting. So called ’smart spaces’ allow interaction with different displays for different activities and add in some ability to communicate with remote or even mobile collaborators on shared documents <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx182" title="">182</a>]</cite>, with additional challenges for multi-disciplinary groups who are perhaps less familiar with one or more of the technology barriers involved <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx183" title="">183</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S6.p2.1">Early systems like clearboard <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx184" title="">184</a>]</cite> demonstrated the potential for smart whiteboards with a webcam component for peer to peer collaborative working. Indeed it is possible to support this modality with Skype and a smartboard system (and up to deployments such as Accessgrid). They remain relatively unpopular however.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S6.p3.1">Displays need not be limited to 2 dimensional screens and can be enhanced in various ways.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S6.p4.1">Stereoscopy allows an illusion of depth to be added to a 2D image by exploiting the stereo depth processing characteristics of the human vision system. This technical approach is not perfect as it does not fully recreate the convergence and focus expected by the eyes and brain.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S6.p5.1">There are multiple approaches to separating the left and right eye images, these primarily being active (where a signal selectively blanks the input to left then right eyes in synchronicity with the display), passive, where either selective spectrum or selective polarisation of light allow different portions of a display access to different eyes, or physical arrangements which present different displays (or slices of light as in lenticular systems) to different eyes.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.p6">
<p id="Ch7.S6.p6.1">These barrier stereoscopy / lenticular displays use vertical light barriers built into the display to create multiple discrete channels of display which are accessed by moving horizontally with respect to the display. In this way it is possible to generate either a left/right eye image pair for ’autostereoscopic’ viewing, or with the addition of head tracking and small motors. With these techniques multiple viewpoint or an adaptive realtime viewpoint update can be presented without the glasses required for active or passive stereoscopic systems.</p></div>

The system uses a large projection screen, a custom table, and carefully defined seating positions. They discussed an “extended perception space" which used identical equipment in the remote spaces in a tightly coupled collaborative ‘booth’. It employed head tracking and multi camera reconstruction alongside large screens built into the booth. This system exemplified the physical restrictions which are required to limit the problems of looking into another space through the screen. Fuchs et al. demonstrated a similar system over a wide area network but achieved only limited resolution and frame rate with the technology of the day <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx311" title="">311</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<p id="Ch7.S6.SS1.p5.1">There seems to be less interest recently in large display screens for spatially correct viewpoints between groups. The hardware is technically demanding and there may have been sufficient research done to limit investment in research questions. This doesn’t mean that there is no future for metaverse applications. Imagine one of the new XR studio walls such as that used to film the Mandalorian. With application of telepresence research it would be possible to bring external metaverse participants into the ‘backstage’ virtual scene. These avatars would be able to explore the scene invisible to the actors, but could be given access to visual feeds from the stage side. This is a hybrid virtual/real metaverse with a well researched and understood boundary interface. It would be possible to give different access privileges to different levels of paying ‘film studio tourist’ or investor, with VIPs perhaps commanding a view onto the live filming. At the nadir of this it may be possible to bring producers and directors directly into the virtual studio as avatars on the screen boundary, with a spatially faithful view onto the set. For the purposes of this book it’s also worth noting that NFTs of the experience and corresponding virtual objects from the scene could be monetised and sold within the metaverse.</p></div>

<p id="Ch7.S6.SS2.SSSx1.p1.1">Project Starline, is a next-generation video conferencing technology that aims to create a sense of presence, making you feel like you’re sitting across the table from someone. It uses advanced hardware and software to achieve this.</p><ul id="Ch7.S6.I1">
<li id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix1">
<span>Hardware</span>
<div id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix1.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix1.p1.1">The newer Starline booth is a refined version of earlier models and looks like a large 65-inch display on a stand. It contains color cameras, depth sensors, microphones, and speakers. Additionally, there are lights on the back of the display that serve as a key light for the person on the call. These lights are mounted around the person and used to create a depth map of the subject and the room they’re in.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix2">
<span>Display</span>
<div id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix2.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix2.p1.1">The display creates an immersive 3D depth effect. It uses a barrier lenticular light field display that shows a different image to your left eye and to your right eye. This effect lets you compute depth on the fly while doing all the head tracking in real time. The display technology in Project Starline is significantly smoother and more realistic than what you would experience with traditional 3D movies.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix3">
<span>Compute</span>
<div id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix3.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix3.p1.1">The computing side of Project Starline is responsible for rendering the people using the system into realistic 3D models in real-time. It uses AI and depth information gathered by the cameras to map the exact shape, depth, texture, and lighting of the person. The result is an ultra-realistic 3D representation of the person on the other end of the call.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix4">
<span>Audio</span>
<div id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix4.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S6.I1.ix4.p1.1">The system features spatial audio such that the perceived audio changes based on where you are leaning or moving, creating an even more immersive and realistic experience.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch7.S6.SS2.SSSx1.p1.2">At this point, Google has been working with several companies who are using these booths for meetings, and it’s hoped that as the technology becomes cheaper and more refined, it they assert that it could revolutionize the way we communicate, though the cost of the system and ‘single user to single user’ restriction is likely to be a blocker to crucial business adoption.</p></div>

<h6>Uncanniness</h6>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p1.1">When employing simulation representations of humans it may be the case that there is an element of weirdness to some of these systems, especially those that currently represent a head without a body. Mori has demonstrated The Uncanny Valley <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx323" title="">323</a>]</cite> effect in which imperfect representations of humans elicit revulsion in certain observers. This provides a toolkit for inspecting potentially ‘weird’ representations, especially if they are ‘eerie’ and is testable through Mori’s GODSPEED questionnaire.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p2.1">With an improved analysis of the shape of the likeability curve estimated later showing a more nuanced response from respondents where anthropomorphism of characters demonstrated increased likeability even against a human baseline <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx324" title="">324</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx325" title="">325</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p3.1">A mismatch in the human realism of face and voice also produces an Uncanny Valley response <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx326" title="">326</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p4.1">However, there is a possibility that Mori’s hypothesis may be too simplistic for practical everyday use in CG and robotics research since anthropomorphism can be ascribed to many and interdependent features such as movement and content of interaction <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx325" title="">325</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p5.1">Bartneck et al. also performed tests which suggest that the original Uncanny Valley assertions may be incorrect, and that it may be inappropriate to map human responses to human simulacrum to such a simplistic scale. They suggest that the measure has been a convenient ‘escape route’ for researchers <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx325" title="">325</a>]</cite>. Their suggestion that the measure should not hold back the development of more realistic robots holds less bearing for the main thrust of this telepresence research which seeks to capture issues with imperfect video representation rather than test the validity of an approximation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p6">
<p id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p6.1">Interestingly Ho et al. performed tests on a variety of facial representations using images. They found that facial performance is a ‘double edged sword’ with realism being important to robotic representations, but there also being a significant Uncanny Valley effect around ‘eerie, creepy, and strange’ which can be avoided by good design <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx327" title="">327</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p7">
<p id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p7.1">More humanlike representations exhibiting higher realism produce more positive social interactions when subjective measures are used <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx262" title="">262</a>]</cite> but not when objective measures are used. This suggests that questionnaires may be more important when assessing potential uncanniness.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p8">
<p id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx1.p8.1">A far more objective method would be to measure user responses to humans, robots, and representations with functional near-infrared spectroscopy and while this has been attempted it is early exploratory research <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx328" title="">328</a>]</cite>, an emotional response to ‘eerie’ was discovered.</p></div>

<h6>Shader lamps</h6>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx4.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx4.p1.1">Projection mapping is a computational augmented projection technique where consideration of the relative positions and angles of complex surfaces allows the projection from single or multiple sources to augment the physical shapes onto which they appear. It was first considered by the <a href="https://rabcup.com/the-history-of-3d-projection-mapping/" title="">Disney corporation in 1969</a> and was given prominence by Raskar and Fuchs with “office of the future" <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx349" title="">349</a>]</cite> and later by Raskar and other researchers <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx341" title="">341</a>]</cite>. It has since gained considerable commercial popularity in live entertainment.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx4.p2">

It is possible to use the technique alongside reconstruction to project onto a white facial mannequin. Researchers have attempted to use the technology for remote patient diagnostic, projecting onto styrofoam heads <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx350" title="">350</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx4.p3">

This is beyond the scope of the proposed projection onto furniture since we wish to keep the system as simple as possible, but could be useful for shared tasks in the future work.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx4.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx4.p4.1">Lincoln et al. employed animatronic avatars which they projected with shader lamps. This combination recreated facial expression and head movement though they were limited in speed and range of control of the remote head <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx340" title="">340</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<h6>Metaverse</h6>

<p id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx5.p1.1">In supporting business it’s not clear that performance is improved or even maintained by the use of a metaverse. Xi et al. found a significant negative impact to productivity within metaverse applications <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx354" title="">354</a>]</cite>.

It seems at this stage that if we are determined to explore metaverse for business then we <a href="http://www.sigtrapgames.com/vrtp/" title="">should mitigate</a> the problems as much as possible using the understanding we have gained so far. It might seem that in so doing there is no difference between immersive collaborative mixed reality (described above) and metaverse at all. We feel that the point of metaverse may be in <span id="Ch7.S6.SS3.SSSx5.p1.1.1">access to</span>, if not reliance upon, a mechanism for global truth. What we will go on to describe is likely to look more like traditional telecollaboration for small focussed teams, working on real-world problems, but we will always maintain an access to both the ability to scale, and a global register of value, trust, and truth (digital assets).</p></div>

<h5>
<span>7.7.1 </span>Problem Statement</h5>
<div id="Ch7.S7.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S7.SS1.p1.1">It’s very likely that the ‘social first’ metaverse attemps such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23391895/meta-facebook-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-too-buggy-leaked-memo" title="">Meta Horizons</a>, Sandbox, and Decentraland are <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/07/its-lonely-in-the-metaverse-decentralands-38-daily-active-users-in-a-13b-ecosystem/" title="">failing</a> to capture audiences. They will likely crash back down the hype curve as ‘Second Life’ did before them. Games based worlds such as Roblox are fairing better, but it’s unclear if they have any longevity, and they do not fulfil ambitions of an open metaverse.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S7.SS1.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S7.SS1.p2.1">Worse yet it seems that metaverse is not the most useful way to conduct business. It is evident that there are multiple factors which contribute to successful human-human communication. These factors remain important in telecommunication supported by technology, and are variously supported, unsupported, or modified by particular technologies. Third person large scale metaverse are clearly amongst the worse of the solutions.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S7.SS1.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S7.SS1.p3.1">Of particular importance is interpersonal gaze <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx223" title="">223</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx198" title="">198</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx224" title="">224</a>]</cite>. Non-verbal cues are also important across multiple modalities of sight, sound <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx200" title="">200</a>]</cite>, and position of interlocutors <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx207" title="">207</a>]</cite>, extending to the whole body <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx198" title="">198</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx236" title="">236</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S7.SS1.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S7.SS1.p4.1">While formal meeting paradigms are pretty well supported by commercially deployed systems, such ICT can be expensive, may need to be professionally managed, and high end equipment in board rooms are generally booked well in advance. These meetings seem to demand many smaller supporting meetings between parties or groups of parties. The pressure here is clearly toward the now ubiquitous Teams and Zoom style formats, and these offer very poor support for social cues, and incur additional fatigue. These are known and well researched problems, and is is possible that the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/future-of-work-meta-connect-2022-quest-pro-microsoft-accenture/?" title="">strategic pairing of Meta Horizons and Microsoft Teams</a> will succeed where previous attempted have failed. They seem to finally have the right assets and opportunity.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S7.SS1.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S7.SS1.p5.1">The ‘problem’ is a supporting technology for small less formal groups, or ad-hoc groups meeting to add clarity or context to formal meetings. Metaverse allows this kind of interaction, while not seeming to replace formal meeting utility. Metaverse also may connect home and work spaces without bringing in those backgrouds, creating a level playing field. A more advanced metaverse interface could also allow dynamism and movement, connection of natural non vocal cues, without too much encumbering technology overhead.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>7.8 </span>Post ‘Meta’ metaverse</h4>
<div id="Ch7.S8.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S8.p1.1">The current media around “metaverse” has been seeded by Mark Zuckerberg’s rebranding of his Facebook company to ‘Meta’, and his planned investment in the technology. Kraus et al suggest that this seems more a marketing and communication drive than a true shift in the company business model <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx357" title="">357</a>]</cite>, but despite this Park and Kim identify dozens of recent papers of metaverse research emerging from Meta labs <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx159" title="">159</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S8.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S8.p2.1">In Stephenson’s ‘Snow Crash’ the Hero Protagonist (drolly called Hiro Protagonist) spends much of the novel in a dystopian virtual environment called the metaverse. It is unclear if Facebook is deliberately embracing the irony of aping such a dystopian image, but certainly their known predisposition for corporate surveillance, alongside their attempt at a global digital money is <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2022/04/12/the-facebook-whistleblower-takes-on-the-metaverse-00024762" title="">ringing alarm bells</a>, as is their <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/metas-new-47-5-fee-on-metaverse-items-has-nft-twitter-pissed/" title="">current plan</a> for monetisation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S8.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S8.p3.1">The second order hype is likely a <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/framing-the-future-of-web-3.0-metaverse-edition.html" title="">speculative play</a> by major companies on the future of the internet. Grayscale investment <a href="https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grayscale_Metaverse_Report_Nov2021.pdf" title="">published a report</a> which views Metaverse as a potential trillion dollar global industry. Such industry reports are given to hyperbole, but it seems the technology is becoming the focus of technology investment narratives. Some notable exerts from a <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm/treasury-services/documents/opportunities-in-the-metaverse.pdf" title="">2021 report</a> by American bank JPMorgan show how the legacy financial institutions see this opportunity:</p></div>

<li id="Ch7.S8.I1.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S8.I1.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S8.I1.i1.p1.1">In the view of the report <span id="Ch7.S8.I1.i1.p1.1.1">“The metaverse is a seamless convergence of our physical and digital lives, creating a unified, virtual community where we can work, play, relax, transact, and socialize.” - this isn’t the worst definition, and very much plays into both the value and mixed reality themes explored in this book.</span></p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S8.I1.i2">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S8.I1.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S8.I1.i2.p1.1">They agree with the industry that monetisation of assets in metaverse applications is called “Metanomics”. It’s worth seeing this word once, as it’s clearly gaining traction, but it won’t be used in this book.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S8.I1.i3">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S8.I1.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S8.I1.i3.p1.1">They make a point which is at the core of this book, that value transaction within metaverses may remove effective border controls for working globally. Be this teleoperation of robots, education, or shop fronts in a completely immersive VR world. They say: <span id="Ch7.S8.I1.i3.p1.1.1">“One of the great possibilities of the metaverse is that it will massively expand access to the marketplace for consumers from emerging and frontier economies. The internet has already unlocked access to goods and services that were previously out of reach. Now, workers in low-income countries, for example, may be able to get jobs in western companies without having to emigrate.”</span></p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S8.I1.i4">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S8.I1.i4.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S8.I1.i4.p1.1">There is a passage which foreshadows some of the choices made in this book: <span id="Ch7.S8.I1.i4.p1.1.1">“Expanded data analytics and reporting for virtual spaces. These will be specifically designated for commercial and marketing usage and will track business key performance indicators (this
already exists in some worlds, such as Cryptovoxels)”</span>. More on this later.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S8.I1.i5">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S8.I1.i5.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S8.I1.i5.p1.1">The report attempts to explore the web3 &amp; cryptocurrency angles of metaverse. That’s also the aim of this book, but they have taken a much more constrained approach, ignoring the possibilities within Bitcoin.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S8.I1.i6">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S8.I1.i6.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S8.I1.i6.p1.1">They assert that strong regulatory capture, identification, KYC/AML etc should underpin their vision of the metaverse. This is far from the community driven and organically emergent narratives that underpin Web3. This is their corporate viewpoint, something they have to say. On the back of this they pitch their consultancy services in these areas.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch7.S8.p4.1">There has been a reactive pushback against commercialisation and corporateisation by the wider tech community, who are <a href="https://www.metaversethics.org/p/mde02-metaverse-data-privacy-1" title="">concerned about</a> the aforementioned monetisation of biometrics. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/19/meta-leans-in-to-tracking-your-emotions-in-the-metaverse/" title="">Observers do not trust</a> these ‘web’ players with such a potentially powerful social medium. It is very plausible that this is all just a marketing play that goes nowhere and fizzles out. It is by no means clear that people want to spend time socialising globally in virtual and mixed reality. These major companies are making an asymmetric bet that if there is a move into virtual worlds, then they need to be stakeholders in the gatekeeping capabilities of those worlds.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S8.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S8.p5.1">To paraphrase Olson; the salesmen peddling the inevitability of the metaverse are stuck clinging to aesthetic details because, without them, they’re just talking about the internet. While virtual reality is enjoying hype right now, and will continue to develop, it faces significant challenges related to the human body’s physiological limitations. For instance, the inner ear can become disoriented when a user experiences virtual movement without physically moving. This issue has led to the development of VR applications that require compromises between immersion and physical comfort.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>7.9 </span>Market analysis</h4>
<div id="Ch7.S9.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S9.p1.1">The market penetration analysis for VR which rings most true for us is provided by Thrive Analytics, and ARtillery Intelligence. Their report is titled “<a href="https://artilleryiq.com/reports/vr-usage-consumer-attitudes-wave-vi/" title="">VR Usage &amp; Consumer Attitudes, Wave VI</a>”. In the USA (which is the cohort they surveyed) they found that adoption of VR headsets is slower than predicted (their work is longitudinal), but steady. Some highlight points are:</p><ul id="Ch7.S9.I1">
<li id="Ch7.S9.I1.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S9.I1.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S9.I1.i1.p1.1">23 percent of U.S. adults own or <span id="Ch7.S9.I1.i1.p1.1.1">have used</span> VR technology. This is around 4% up from the previous survey in 2020. Frustratingly, and very much in keeping with such industry surveys they conflate ‘own’ with ’have used’ making this data pretty meaningless from an adoption point of view.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S9.I1.i2">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S9.I1.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S9.I1.i2.p1.1">there is a skew toward male users of around 10%, and a far larger skew toward younger users, and a bias toward richer households. These are indicative of a technology that’s still early in it’s adoption cycle.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S9.I1.i3">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S9.I1.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S9.I1.i3.p1.1">Of the owners of the technology (no indication what percentage this is) they found that around a third used the equipment regularly, but that this retention number was gently falling.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S9.I1.i4">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S9.I1.i4.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S9.I1.i4.p1.1">Standalone headsets (Quest 2 and Pico 4) without a cabled connection to a computer are far more popular, and have better user retention. This makes sense as the alternative demands either space or setup time.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S9.I1.i5">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S9.I1.i5.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S9.I1.i5.p1.1">Buyers of these more popular headsets are very sensitive to price. Note here that Meta is selling Quest2 at a loss to drive the market. This is unsustainable.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S9.I1.i6">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S9.I1.i6.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S9.I1.i6.p1.1">Overall this snapshot of adoption feels pretty neutral, and is being driven by losses to Facebook/Meta share price.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="Ch7.S9.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S9.p2.1">Deloitte have just <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/digital-consumer-trends-2022-metaverse.html" title="">conducted a UK survey</a>. This covers “metaverse, virtual reality, and web3 (i.e. blockchain-based assets like Bitcoin”, and so is perfect for our needs. They have similar results to the bigger US survey. Their key finding are quoted below verbatim:</p><ul id="Ch7.S9.I2">
<li id="Ch7.S9.I2.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S9.I2.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S9.I2.i1.p1.1">63% of respondents have heard of the term “metaverse”. However, roughly half of those know nothing about it.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S9.I2.i2">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S9.I2.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S9.I2.i2.p1.1">Only 18% of VR headsets are used daily, from the 8% of individuals that claim to have access to one.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S9.I2.i3">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S9.I2.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S9.I2.i3.p1.1">Consumers may be wary of web 3. While most people (93%) have heard of cryptocurrency, only one in five (19%) know at least a “fair amount” about it. Knowledge of NFTs is rarer still.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch7.S9.I2.i4">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch7.S9.I2.i4.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S9.I2.i4.p1.1">70% of those who have heard of these assets say they are unlikely to buy them in the next, and cite fraud, scams and a lack of regulation as key concerns.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch7.S9.p2.2">Deloitte feel that “content is key” for virtual reality to be a success, but we would instead argue that applications are key. Nearly half of their respondents were simply “not interested in VR”. We think this matches our longstanding understanding of the reality of the market. A few vocal proponents of the technology does not necessarily lead to a developed and mature mass appeal. Again, we feel that real world use cases will drive adoption over a longer time frame. Virtual meetings do not feel like that application to us.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S9.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S9.p3.1">They feel that ‘one metaverse’ would require blockchain/web3 tooling for a common consensus frame, and we agree with this. It seems like a very long way to that point, and perhaps not worth the effort. They, like us, see compatible silos as being the interim step.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S9.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S9.p4.1">They (unusually) have a legal opinion in the text, and this is valuable enough to quote verbatim once again.
<span id="Ch7.S9.p4.1.1">“The metaverse amplifies existing legal issues and raises new ones. Centralised metaverses, such as those focused on games, tend to engage consumers in a controlled space and operate within familiar legal frameworks. For example, users purchasing a virtual accessory are likely to understand its use will be within tightly prescribed
parameters. Decentralised metaverses, which incorporate web3 (such as NFTs) are more challenging, as users may expect virtual assets to be portable. However, those assets are governed by inconsistent and often unclear terms, and the lack of technical standards can result in limited interoperability between metaverses. For the user, social interactions in virtual worlds can feel realistic, inviting scrutiny from policymakers and regulators focused on online
safety. An increased legislative focus on children online will also require platforms to assess or verify the age of users. And collection of personal data – such as eye movement within a VR headset – will require informed consent under data protection laws, and a clear understanding of who is controlling that data at any given time.
Finally, as content is key, clear contractual parameters are required to frame how intellectual property is used, whether user-generated content is permitted, and how illegal/harmful content is managed.
Amid all of this, metaverse builders, content owners and brands must ensure they have a risk assessment and risk management framework
in place to avoid costly mistakes, both reputational and financial, in an increasingly regulated space.”</span></p></div>

<span>7.10 </span>NFT and crypto as metaverse</h4>
<div id="Ch7.S10.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S10.p1.1">Within the NFT, Web3 and crypto community it is normalised to refer to ownership of digital tokens as participation in a metaverse. This is reflected in the market analysis above. This fusing of narratives is reviewed in detail by Gadekallu et al in their excellent recent paper on Metaverse and Blockchain <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx358" title="">358</a>]</cite>. They conclude that much remains to be done here. This CNBC article highlights the confusion, as this major news outlet refers to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/16/walmart-is-quietly-preparing-to-enter-the-metaverse.html" title="">Walmart prepares to offer NFTs</a>” as an entry “into the metaverse”.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>7.11 </span>Lessons from MMORGS</h4>
<div id="Ch7.S11.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S11.p1.1">The concept of ‘instrumental play’ was introduced by literary theorist Wolfgang Iser in his 1993 essay “The Fictive and the Imaginary” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx359" title="">359</a>]</cite>. Iser divided play into two categories, free play and instrumental play, based on their relationship to goals. In his view, play becomes instrumental the moment it has a goal or a set of rules. The application of this concept to massively multiplayer online games was later explored by sociologist T.L Taylor in her 2006 book ‘Play Between Worlds’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx360" title="">360</a>]</cite>. According to Taylor, instrumental play is a goal-oriented approach that values efficiency, expertise, and strategy optimization. The point of playing is not to reach the end but to find the best way to get there.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S11.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S11.p2.1">The distinction between instrumental play and fun is often seen as a false dichotomy. The two are not mutually exclusive but exist in tension. Optimization can result in player behaviours that are simply no fun, but achieving goals or improving skills can also bring enjoyment. René Glas in his book ‘Battlefields of Negotiation’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx361" title="">361</a>]</cite> describes the movement between instrumental and free play in World of Warcraft, which has the distinction of evolving across entirely different iterations of the Internet.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S11.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S11.p3.1">These virtual worlds of massively multiplayer online games are "interactively stabilized" systems, the result of the interaction between game designers and players. The social codes of practice established by players can shape what is considered legitimate play. Success in these games is dynamically defined by consensus, as seen in Mark Chen’s study of World of Warcraft ‘Leet Noobs’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx362" title="">362</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S11.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S11.p4.1">Tom Boellstorff conducted a study of user experiences in Second Life <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx363" title="">363</a>]</cite>, which was criticized for not involving real life or other websites or software in the analysis. The virtual worlds of massively multiplayer online games are not enclosed and players can engage with these games through various platforms, such as Discord, Twitch, Twitter, and Google Docs, without physically inhabiting the virtual world. This concept of "paratext" was first introduced by French literary theorist Gerard Genette. He saw a book as containing the text of the book and additional components, such as the cover, title, foreword, etc., that are necessary to complete the book but not part of the primary text. These additional texts influence the meaning of the primary text. The definition was later expanded by Mia Consalvo, who defined paratext as any text that “may alter the meanings of a text, further enhance meanings, or provide challenges to sedimented meanings.” Examples of paratext include reviews, pre-release trailers, etc. Kristine Ask observed the impact of paratext on theorycrafting expertise in World of Warcraft, which was later confirmed by the rise of twitch streams. Mark Chen’s dissertation Leet Noobs focuses on how AddOns in World of Warcraft can become essential agents in raid groups by assuming cognitive load. The concept is based on the idea of object-oriented ontology and actor-network theory <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx364" title="">364</a>]</cite>. These theories are complex and contested, but the boundaries between real people and virtual AI actors in virtual social spaces are certainly blurred.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S11.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S11.p5.1">Virtual spaces are not separate from the real world, but are instead an extension of it. The key factor in making a virtual world compelling is not its realism, but the fact that people give meaning to their lives by entangling themselves in projects with others, even when those others are not other people. Worlds become real when people care about them, not when they look like the real world.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>7.12.1 </span>More like a digital twin</h5>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS1.p1.1">One of the most intuitive ways to view a metaverse is as a virtual landscape. This is how metaverse was portrayed in the original Neal Stephenson use of the word. ‘Digital twin’ is another much abused industry term which trends toward a 3D representation of real world spaces and objects. Sometimes these virtual objects are connected to the real by telemetry, allowing industrial monitoring applications. Much is made of such systems in simulation brochures, and on the web, but it’s surprisingly hard to find real world applications of the idea outside of complex large scale systems engineering (aerospace). The costs of maintenance are simply too high. The US army owns the digital twin which could be called <a href="https://www.army.mil/standto/archive/2018/03/26/" title="">closest to “The Metaverse”</a> (note the intentional capitalisation). Their global simulation environment mirrors real world locations for their training needs. The European space agency is building an <span>Earth digital twin</span> for climate research, as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcfall22-a41326/?playlistId=playList-9bb5405e-3e40-4ff3-88db-61cd3a4507e5#:~:text=Earth%2D2%20aims%20to%20improve,learning%20methods%20at%20unprecedented%20scale." title="">is Nvidia</a>, but again it’s unclear what this offers over and above access to direct data feeds, and of course such an ambitious project likely has an ecological cost!</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS1.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS1.p2.1">Within industry digital twins are seen as the primary use case for metaverse, with even the world economic forum <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/metaverse-biggest-impact-industry-davos2023/" title="">subscribing to the hype</a>. To be clear, there is enormous effort, investment, and potential here, but it feels outside of the scope of this product at this time.</p></div>

Investment in the metaverse ‘angle’ of the platform is stepping up with recent announcements such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/03/spotify-becomes-first-music-streamer-to-launch-on-roblox/?" title="">“Spotify Island”</a>. The company has announced text based generative art creation of scenes, and is integrating the playstation headset in their PS4 release. It’s very notable that it still <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/06/03/roblox-gaming-ecosystem-metaverse-stocks-profit/" title="">hasn’t become a profitable business</a>. It is important to note that Roblox has banned NFTs. Nike have <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/09/22/21m-people-have-now-visited-nike-s-roblox-store-here-s-how-do-metaverse-commerce" title="">garnered significant attention</a> for their metaverse store, front with their Roblox based metaverse. As <a href="https://medium.com/@theo/why-nikeland-is-not-the-metaverse-success-story-you-think-it-is-46742dc2f231" title="">Theo Priestley</a> points out this is likely just another expensive experiment, with a finite lifespan.

<div id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx10.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx10.p2.1">“VRChat’s gameplay is similar to that of games such as Second Life and Habbo Hotel. Players can create their own instanced worlds in which they can interact with each other through virtual avatars. A software development kit for Unity released alongside the game gives players the ability to create or import character models to be used in the platform, as well as build their own worlds.</p></div>

<div id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx10.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx10.p5.1">In 2020, a new visual programming language was introduced known as "Udon", which uses a node graph system. While still considered alpha software, it became usable on publicly-accessible worlds beginning in April 2020. A third-party compiler known as "UdonSharp" was developed to allow world scripts to be written in C sharp.”</p></div>

<p id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx11.p1.1">Horizon Worlds is the Meta (Facebook) meteverse, and Workrooms it’s business offering and a subset of the “Worlds” global system. It is currently a walled garden without connection to the outside digital world, and arguably not therefore a metaverse.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx11.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx11.p2.1">The Financial Times <span>took a look</span> at their patent applications and noted that the travel is toward increased user behaviour tracking, and targeted advertising.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx11.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx11.p3.1">Facebook actually have a poor history on innovation and diversification of their business model. This model has previously been tracking users to target ads on their platform, while increasing and maintaining attention using machine learning algorithms.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx11.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx11.p4.1">It makes complete sense then to analyse the move by Meta into 3D social spaces as an attempt to front run the technology using their huge investment capacity. Facebook have recently taken a huge hit to their share price. Nothing seems to have changed in the underling business except Zuckerberg’s well publicised shift to supporting a money losing gamble on the Metaverse. It is by no means clear that users want this, that Meta will be able to better target ads on this new platform, or that the markets are willing to trust Zuckerburg on this proactive move.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx11.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS2.SSSx11.p5.1">With all this said the investment and management capacity and capability at Meta cannot be dismissed. It is very likely that Meta will be able to rapidly deploy a 3D social space, and that it’s development will continue to be strong for years. The main interface for Horizon Worlds is through the Meta owned and developer Oculus headset, which is excellent and reasonably affordable. It has been quite poorly received <a href="https://kotaku.com/facebook-metaverse-horizon-worlds-vr-oculus-quest-2-cha-1848436740" title="">by reviewers</a> but will likely improve, especially if users are encouraged to innovate.</p></div>

The users can shop, buy things, invest, and purchase goods in a virtual space. The project is built on Ethereum and has a (speculative) valuation in the billions of dollars.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p2.1">Decentraland was launched in February 2020, and its history includes an initial coin offering in August 2017, where their MANA token sale raised approximately $24 million dollars in crypto coins. This was followed by a “terraforming event” where parcels of land, denominated in LAND tokens, were auctioned off for an additional $28 million in crypto. The initial pitch for Decentraland emphasized the opportunity to own the virtual world, create, develop, and trade without limits, make genuine connections, and earn real money. However, the actual experience in Decentraland has faced criticisms such as poor graphics, performance issues, and limited content. They have recently dropped their pretence of ever supporting VR.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p3.1">One example of these limitations is the now-defunct pizza kiosk that aimed to facilitate ordering Domino’s pizza via the metaverse using cryptocurrency. This concept, though intriguing, was hindered by a lack of official support from Domino’s and the inherent inefficiencies of using a virtual world as an intermediary for purchasing goods and services.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p4.1">Similarly, attempts to create virtual amusement park rides and attractions within Decentraland have suffered from poor performance and a lack of interactivity. These issues stem from the limitations of the tools and resources available for building experiences within the platform, as well as the inherent difficulties in creating engaging experiences in a ‘world’ that is supposed to perform too many functions at once.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p5">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p5.1">In addition to the technical challenges, Decentraland (and all these crypto metaverse projects) have clearly promoting unrealistic expectations to foster speculative investments. The notion that businesses and individuals will eventually “live inside” the metaverse is not only a poetic interpretation but also an unrealistic expectation given the current state of VR technology.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p6">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p6.1">As it stands, Decentraland is unlikely realize its supposed potential as an invisible, seamless infrastructure for a wide range of digital experiences. Until the platform can address its core issues, it is likely that projects like the ‘Decentraland Report’ (it’s user delivered news platform), and others will continue to fail to deliver on their promises. To quote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiZhdpLXZ8Q" title="">Olson’s highly critical</a> (and correct) presentation on Decentraland: 
<br>textit“..it can’t even handle properly emulating Breakout, a game from 1976 that you can play on goddamn Google images! Steve Wozniak built Breakout fifty years ago to run on 44 TTL chips and a ham sandwich and that’s still somehow too demanding a gaming experience …”</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p7">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx1.p7.1">Like all of these attempts the actual information content of within Decentraland boils down to text on billboards, and links to the outside Web. It’s a terrible product, and really just another example of a crypto scam which never really intended to be developed for the long haul.</p></div>

<h6>Sandbox</h6>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx2.p1.1">The Sandbox, a decentralized gaming platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, has garnered attention for its promise of a vibrant ecosystem filled with user-generated content. However, despite its ambitious vision, the project has faced various challenges and criticisms similar to Decentraland. Limited use cases and adoption remain a significant challenge for The Sandbox. While the platform aims to create a vast and engaging gaming ecosystem, it has yet to gain widespread adoption, leading to a limited number of users and developers. This lack of user engagement raises questions about the long-term viability of the project, as the value of virtual land, assets, and in-game experiences may remain limited without a thriving community. Like Decentraland it is a manipulated hype bubble, attracting glowing paid press reports in some media, and ‘interest’ from national and regional ‘branches’ of global brands which are then spun to create artificial hype in main stream media. The tradable NFTs within these early platforms are obviously subject to insider trading, price volatility, wash trading, and other harmful activities.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx2.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx2.p2.1">The Sandbox places too much emphasis on the speculative aspect of virtual land and asset trading, rather than focusing on creating a genuinely engaging gaming ecosystem. This focus on speculation could lead to an unsustainable bubble with inflated asset prices, and it seems likely we have already seen most of the collapse of this ecosystem.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx2.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx2.p3.1">The actual experience of interacting with The Sandbox’s gaming products leaves much to be desired. For instance, the platform’s games may suffer from lag and poor performance due to the technical limitations of blockchain technology. Additionally, the quality of user-generated content can be highly variable, as not all creators possess the skills and resources to develop engaging gaming experiences. As a result, users might find themselves sifting through a plethora of low-quality games, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx2.p4">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx2.p4.1">Concerns about centralization persist, as some critics argue that the project is not entirely decentralized. The team behind The Sandbox still holds a significant amount of control over the platform’s development and governance, potentially undermining the project’s core vision of a decentralized gaming ecosystem.</p></div>

<div id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx3.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS3.SSSx3.p1.1">Somnium Space is just another one of these, but with more VR. It allows users to join in either through a downloadable VR client or a browser-based version to function like any other web app. It suffered the same problems at Decentraland and Sandbox. They are terrible products, with hype, manufactured by money, extracted from users, often convinced by paid celebrity endorsements. It’s the NFT space, but sadder, and technically worse, and likely not for very much longer.</p></div>

<p id="Ch7.S12.SS4.p1.1">As the word metaverse has gained in use, so have some traditional users and researchers in mixed reality switched to use of the term.
Siyaev and Jo describe an aircraft training metaverse which incorporates ML based speech recognition <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx365" title="">365</a>]</cite>. This class of mixed reality trainer traditionally finds positive results, but is highly task specific.</p></div>
<section id="Ch7.S12.SS4.SSSx1">
<h6>Global enterprise perspective</h6>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS4.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS4.SSSx1.p1.1">Microsoft have just bought Activision / Blizzard for around seventy billion dollars. This has been communicated by Microsoft executives as a “Metaverse play”, leveraging their internal game item markets, and their massive multiplayer game worlds to build toward a closed metaverse experience like the one Meta is planning.
This builds on the success of early experiments like the Fornite based music concerts, which attracted millions of concurrent users to live events.
</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S12.SS4.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S12.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1">There are three emerging focuses, the social metaverses for pleasure, and business metaverses for larger group meetings and training <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx366" title="">366</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx367" title="">367</a>]</cite>, and a Nvidia’s evolving <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/08/09/omniverse-siggraph/" title="">collaborative creation metaverse</a> for digital engineers and creatives. They’re all pretty different ‘classes’ of problem. The social metaverse angle where Facebook is concentrating most effort is of less interest to us here, though obviously markets will exist in such systems for business to customer. The next section will explore some of the software tools available to connect people. Everything looks pretty basic right now in all the available systems, but that will likely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRLnR4Kot2M" title="">change over the next couple of years</a>.</p></div>

<div id="Ch7.S15.SS3.p3">
<p id="Ch7.S15.SS3.p3.1">In a <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/tim-cook-global-creativity-awards-cover-2023?mbid=social_twitter" title="">GQ profile</a> Cook, the Apple CEO talked at length about the challenges and opportunities of AR headsets. He has been emphasizing the importance of augmented reality over VR for almost a decade, believing that AR can enhance communication and connection by overlaying digital elements on the physical world. Cook’s vision aligns with Apple’s rumoured mixed reality headset, which is expected to cost around $3,000 and focus on ‘copresence’, which we have discussed at length in this chapter. Apple’s approach differs from Meta’s metaverse, as Apple aims to integrate digital aspects into the real world rather than create purely digital spaces. This is an interesting area for our applications of bringing small teams together, but the pricing at this time is significantly at odds with our chosen market. Cook, like this book, has highlighted AR’s potential in education and its ability to bring people together in the real world.</p></div>

<span>7.16 </span>Risks</h4>
<div id="Ch7.S16.p1">
<p id="Ch7.S16.p1.1">Metaverse is fraught with risks, partly because it’s new, and partly because of the pace of adoption. Regulation is well behind the technology, to the alarm of some academic observers <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx372" title="">372</a>]</cite>.</p><ul id="Ch7.S16.I1">

<p id="Ch7.S16.I1.i1.p1.1">Abuse; because of the real-time and spatio-temporal abuse happens less like in the current web 2 social media, and more like in the real world, but with less opportunity for repercussions. It might be that natural language processing and machine learning can help with this, but it’s a tough problem. One idea might be to record the speech to text of interactions between participants, and flag to them if a “bullying, harassment, predation threshold” is met. This could be encrypted with the public keys of the participants and a notice sent to them that if they wished to follow up with authorities then they have the necessary attestations and proofs. This is minimally invasive and privacy preserving, and acts as a strong disincentive to repeat offence. It can also feed into a global “web of trust” reputation system in a ‘zero knowledge’ way. Users who flag abuse to the reputation system can leverage the machine learning opinion without revealing what happened (though they would have the data). This would also act as a disincentive without the social stigma issues of reporting.</p></div>
<div id="Ch7.S16.I1.i1.p2">
<p id="Ch7.S16.I1.i1.p2.1">Reporting could be achieved without machine learning identification of potential problems, but there would have to be a social cost to reporting (like gossiping incessantly about others) which would erode the social score of the reporting entity.

<span>8.1.1 </span>Overview</h5>
<div id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p1.1">Though the history of this field reaches back to the 1940’s with McCulloch et al. exploration of the possible mathematical underpinnings of human brain neurons <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx373" title="">373</a>]</cite>. During the writing of this book we have seen an inflection point in machine learning, to the point where the term “artificial intelligence” is feeling intuitively and subjectively real for the first time. To be clear AI is still a pretty meaningless term. ‘Intelligence’ is one of those slippery words which is highly dependent on context. A satnav system running on a phone can make an intelligent choice about a route by synthesising data and presenting comprehensible results, but it seems absurd to ascribe an intelligence to it. It’s possible that there’s some kind of “spoooky” quantum activity in play in a conscious human brain, as described in mind bending mathematical depth by Penrose in 1989 <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx374" title="">374</a>]</cite>. It’s something of an unknown unknown <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx375" title="">375</a>]</cite>, and that we’ll never get to what’s called ‘strong’ or ‘general’ AI <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx376" title="">376</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx377" title="">377</a>]</cite>, reserved by some scientists for “true consciousness”, whatever that means <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx378" title="">378</a>]</cite>. With that said we may be approaching the threshold of the ‘Turing Test‘ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx379" title="">379</a>]</cite>, initially posited by Alan Turing in 1950 <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx380" title="">380</a>]</cite>, and the goalposts have begun to move in response to claims that there have been successful examples <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx381" title="">381</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx382" title="">382</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx383" title="">383</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx384" title="">384</a>]</cite>. It feels that in this moment it is appropriate to open with a risks section, and work backwards. This is grounded in the hypothesis that there is no agreed end goal here (as we saw with the Bitcoin/Crypto chapter).</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p2.1">To set the tone here let’s have OpenAI’s ChatGPT give us a definition:
<span id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p2.1.1">Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills in order to solve problems and adapt to new situations. It can involve a range of cognitive abilities, such as perception, learning, memory, reasoning, and decision-making. Intelligence is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been studied by psychologists, philosophers, and scientists for centuries.</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p3.1">The Oxford English Dictionary defines Artificial intelligence as “The capacity of computers or other machines to exhibit or simulate intelligent behaviour”. This is very murky territory. The boundary line between very capable trained systems and something that <span id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p3.1.1">feels</span> like intelligence is obviously a subjective one, and different for each person and context, (Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch8.F1" title="Figure 8.1 ‣ 8.1.1 Overview ‣ 8.1 The Cambrian explosion of ML/AI ‣ Chapter 8 Artificial Intelligence ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>8.1</span></a>.</p></div>

<p id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p4.1">We will use AI and ML interchangeably in this text, but is so doing we hope to draw attention to the moment we find ourselves in. It feels like there is an inflection point in human history happening right now, though to somewhat burst the bubble on this hyperbole it’s worth reading the legendary Stephen Wolframs <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/" title="">explanation of these current systems</a> as glorified autocompletes.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p5">
<p id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p5.1">Irrespective of the gap between the perception and truth around these systems there is now a feedback loop where the data that these systems are trained on will be learning from both human <span id="Ch8.S1.SS1.p5.1.1">and</span> outputs from such systems. Todays young children will never know a world in which the information they encounter is verifiable as of purely human origin. The implications of this are unclear but exciting. In writing this book it became obvious to add this chapter in, and change the direction on the research and product development, because nothing in human history will remain untouched by this. As we will see ‘metaverse’ is likely to change at an incredible rate as a function of some parts of this technology. </p></div>

<span>8.2 </span>Generative art systems</h4>
<div id="Ch8.S2.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.p1.1">Generative art refers to art that is generated algorithmically rather than manually created. In this report, we will provide an overview of generative art, including its history, key techniques, applications, and future outlook.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.p2.1">Generative art emerged in the 1960s alongside early computer art. Artists like Frieder Nake and Georg Nees used algorithms to create abstract visual art. In the 1970s and 80s, fractal geometry allowed for complex recursive patterns. More recently, neural networks have enabled new forms of image generation, and they are the focus of this text.</p></div>

<div id="Ch8.S2.SS3.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS3.p1.1">There’s a good detailed and in depth blog post by Weng <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/#classifier-free-guidance" title="">here</a>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS3.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS3.p2.1">The four main types are over-viewed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7088752096853803008/" title="">by Deshwal</a> as below:</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS3.p3">
<ul id="Ch8.S2.I2">
<li id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix1">
<span>GAN: Generative Adversarial Network</span>
<div id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix1.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix1.p1.1">"Adversarial" as the name suggests are two opposite networks. One learns to create images out of noise (Artist) which is actually very hard process and the other says "umm okay! This isn’t good" (Critic) which is a relatively easy process. So because of the fact that being an artist is very hard than being a critic, these networks are not stable and Critic learns faster than the Artist.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix2">
<span>Auto Encoder style</span>
<div id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix2.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix2.p1.1">VAE, U-Nets etc belong to this category where same network breaks down image in deeper level features using CNN and then rebuild it again. That’s like a child learning by breaking things. VAE and U-Nets are almost same with minor differences and serve as a base model in Diffusion process so that think of them ans analogues to BERT in LLMs.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix3">
<span>Flow Based</span>
<div id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix3.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix3.p1.1">: Well here it becomes complex. You apply function X to an image and then you re-create the original image by applying the Exact inverse of that function. For example, a very basic function is to add 5 and then subtract 5 to get original stuff.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix4">
<span>Diffusion processes</span>
<div id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix4.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.I2.ix4.p1.1">VAE, U-Nets are used as base models. You insert some pseudo random (because you know what you added based on a timestamp "T") Gaussian noise to an image and instead of asking the model to predict original image, you ask the model to predict the Noise that you inserted. Since Gaussian is an additive noise independent of original signal, you subtract that from image and get original image. Another piece is that instead of predicting whole noise at once, you predict the noise for previous (T-1) step.</p></div>

</ul>

<div id="Ch8.S2.SS3.p4">

<div id="Ch8.S2.SS3.p5">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS3.p5.1">Fine-tuning techniques like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242" title="">DreamBooth</a> allow customizing Stable Diffusion by training on datasets of specific concepts. <a href="https://github.com/yfszzx/stylegan-nada" title="">styleGAN-NADA</a> improves image quality through noise optimization. <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3" title="">styleGAN3</a> introduces a generator architecture that achieves state-of-the-art results.

<div id="Ch8.S2.SS3.p7">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS3.p7.1">Beyond generation, image processing techniques can manipulate existing visuals. <a href="https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN" title="">GFPGAN</a> restores blurred faces using facial landmarks and semantic segmentation. <a href="https://github.com/dazhizhong/BRDNet" title="">BRDNet</a> removes unwanted objects through edge-aware propagation and diffusion. <a href="https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN" title="">Real-ESRGAN</a> super-resolves images up to 16x resolution. <a href="https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify" title="">DeOldify</a> colorizes black and white photos through deep learning.

<h5>
<span>8.2.8 </span>Major trends in AI</h5>
<section id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx1">
<h6>The concentration of AI power</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx1.p1.1">In recent times, the arena of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen the emergence of colossal entities that have taken the helm of AI research and development. Prominent players such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI have plunged billions into the cultivation of potent AI architectures, with a special emphasis on large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx1.p2.1">Originating in 2015 as a non-profit entity dedicated to the open exploration of AI for the collective good, OpenAI transitioned from its foundational ethos following a pivotal investment of $1 billion from Microsoft in 2019. This infusion of capital marked a turn towards a more proprietary and competitive orientation, with the endgame of reaching the pinnacle of artificial general intelligence (AGI). In this paradigm shift, OpenAI’s formidable 175 billion parameter behemoth, GPT-4, became an enigmatic entity, shielded from public scrutiny. The rationale provided for this clandestine stance revolved around safety and competitive considerations.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx1.p3.1">Contrastingly, Meta adopted a path of openness, fully disclosing its 65 billion parameter LLaMA 2 LLM, inclusive of the model weights, to the public domain. This ethos is rooted in the belief that a culture of openness propels rapid advancement by paving the way for widespread experimentation and communal contributions. However, it is pertinent to note that Meta’s LLaMA 2 does carry stipulations on commercial exploitation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx1.p4">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx1.p4.1">Initially, Google was at the forefront of AI innovation with its TensorFlow framework, but has seen its leading position eroded by Meta’s PyTorch. Post the commercial success of its products, Google’s AI endeavors have veered towards a more proprietary model, with novel models and academic publications seeing the light of day post commercialization.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx2">
<h6>Concentration of Power and Control</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx2.p1.1">The centralization of AI evolution within the confines of a select few private behemoths such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI or Google engenders a nucleus of power and control over AI advancements. Contrary Research has an <a href="https://research.contrary.com/reports/the-openness-of-ai" title="">excellent report</a> on this. As AI melds deeper into the fabric of products and services, these titans stand to wield extensive sway over the modalities of human communication, thought processes, and information accessibility.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx2.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx2.p2.1">The dependency on a sparse set of centralized LLMs harbors risks such as a widespread dissemination of confidential data in the face of a security breach. Moreover, the consolidated control furnishes these corporations with the means to potentially curtail information or mold narratives in alignment with their vested interests. For instance, OpenAI exercises centralized control over the narrative frameworks of its influential models like ChatGPT.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx3">
<h6>Lack of Transparency and Innovation</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx3.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx3.p1.1">Centralized LLMs exhibit a veil of opacity regarding their operational mechanics and training methodologies. The elusive nature of OpenAI’s GPT-4 renders it a veritable black box, impervious to audits aimed at uncovering issues such as bias within the 175 billion parameter model’s training data. This shroud of mystery precludes informed discourse on the ethical employment of this technology.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx3.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx3.p2.1">On the flip side, Meta’s open-sourced LLaMA facilitates a level of public oversight that could preemptively address inherent issues. The clandestine nature of closed models stifles innovation as it bars a significant portion of the research community from building atop these models. Open ideologies foster a milieu of collaboration, propelling progress forward.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx3.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx3.p3.1">In summation, the monopolization of AI progression and influence within a handful of private juggernauts engenders risks spanning lack of transparency, potential censorship, stifled innovation, and single points of vulnerability. A paradigm shift towards more open and decentralized methodologies is imperative to mitigate these looming threats.

<h6>Some ways of thinking</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx4.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx4.p1.1">Poulter <a href="https://twitter.com/jamespoulter" title="">CEO</a> of Vixen Labs has come up with a somewhat strained analogy he calls “The Central Intelligence Agent”.

<h6>Trusted enterprise AI</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p1.1">Enterprise AI, specifically designed or retrofitted for professional use cases, is becoming a significant theme. This trend is driven by leading companies such as Google, Microsoft, and latterly, curiously, Salesforce. Trust has become a primary consideration. At this early stage in the technology it is important that corporate and private users alike bear in mind that the LLMs are ‘leaky’ and are using the data fed into them to train themselves. They are <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-chatgpt-general-faq" title="">explicit about this</a>. Anything that goes into ChatGPT can resurface, as Samsung have found out <a href="https://cybernews.com/news/chatgpt-samsung-data-leak/" title="">to their cost</a>. At this time the following companies have responded by banning the use of the technology internally.

<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p1.2">There are likely <span id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p1.2.1">many</span> more who have done this less publicly, and indeed I am aware of examples. In response to this <a href="https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt" title="">OpenAI announced</a> a business version of its tool, ChatGPT Business. Clearly this is a premium subscription service designed to be private by default. The service manages multiple users and does not train its future models on any conversations that flow through the business. This approach is a significant step towards establishing trust in AI tools, as it ensures that sensitive business conversations are not used to train AI models.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p2.1">As mentioned, Salesforce has been partially AI-powered for years. They recently announced a series of AI-related developments, including the pilot of ‘Einstein GPT’, dubbed “the world’s first generative AI for CRM”. This tool builds on an existing underlying intelligence layer called Einstein, which has been running in Salesforce since 2016. The new generative Einstein GPT is more content-oriented, helping businesses auto-generate text, pictures, and code. This tool is designed to help sales teams find the most likely next customer to buy. More interestingly they are leveraging their expertise in ‘Salesforce Ventures’ a $500 million fund focused on funding generative AI startups. They have already invested in major projects like Humane, Triple, Anthropic, and Cohere.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p3.1">They have <span id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p3.1.1">also</span> announced an AI Cloud suite: ‘Salesforce’s AI Cloud’. It includes nine GPT-powered applications designed to automate and enhance various business processes. These applications include Sales GPT, Service GPT, Marketing GPT, Commerce GPT, <span id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p3.1.2">Slack GPT</span>, Tableau GPT, Flow GPT, and Apex GPT.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p4">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p4.1">Each of these applications is designed to cater to specific business needs, such as personalizing text generation for emails, automating mundane tasks, customizing messages for different audience segments, and creating workflows from natural language prompts. You can see that our work is already a customer here and this could be built upon.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p5">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx5.p5.1">This suite emphasizes the ‘Einstein GPT Trust Layer’, designed to ensure no potential data leakage, allowing enterprises to use AI for their most sensitive needs. They say this trust layer sits between customer data and the AI models, ensuring that the AI capability can provide predictions without actually looking inside the data. This approach would allow our work to leverage the power of enterprise AI without sacrificing data privacy and/or security.</p></div>

While some believe that AI will disrupt industries in unimaginable ways, others argue that the technology still has a long way to go. Some even argue that the distracting nature of the platforms may be net negative in the short term. Regardless, the current state of Enterprise AI represents a pivotal moment, with companies trying to productise AI and change workflows within large corporations. The impact of these developments could range from a promise of transformation with AI being every bit as disruptive as everyone says it is, to an overhyped flop, as often happens with new technologies. Some industry analysts argue that we’re still in the early stages of AI’s potential impact. Tech analyst Dan Ives likens the current state of AI to a “Gold Rush” moment, suggesting that we’re closer to 1995 than 1999 in terms of AI’s evolution and impact on industries. This perspective suggests that while AI has made significant strides, there’s still a long way to go before it fully transforms the business landscape. I would tentatively agree with this analysis, and avoid over investing in low confidence FOMO plays.</p></div>

This makes it hard to build upon in a trustable way <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx386" title="">386</a>]</cite>.
The team built a dataset with 50 easy problems from LeetCode and measured how many GPT-4 answers ran without any changes. The March version succeeded in 52% of the problems, but this dropped to a pale 10% using the model from June. I assume that OpenAI pushes changes continuously, but we don’t know how the process works and how they evaluate whether the models are improving or regressing.
In my opinion, this is a red flag for anyone building applications that rely on GPT-4. Having the behavior of an LLM change over time is not acceptable.</p></div>

<h6>ChatGPT - Code Interpreter</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx7.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx7.p1.1">The ChatGPT Code Interpreter Plugin, introduced in March 2023, offers a sandboxed environment featuring a working Python interpreter. This environment, which is isolated from other users and the Internet, supports an impressive array of functionalities. It comes pre-loaded with over 330 libraries, including popular ones such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and TensorFlow, among others.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx7.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx7.p2.1">As illustrated in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch8.F8" title="Figure 8.8 ‣ Current LLM Capabilities ‣ 8.2.11 Consumer tools ‣ 8.2 Generative art systems ‣ Chapter 8 Artificial Intelligence ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>8.8</span></a>, the Code Interpreter Plugin is capable of performing a myriad of tasks. For example, it can visualize any data inputted by the user, generate GIFs of the visualizations, and perform file uploads and downloads. It can extract colors from an image to create a color palette, and autonomously compress large images when memory is running low. Moreover, the plugin can clean and process data, generate insightful visualizations, and convert files to different formats quickly and efficiently.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx7.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx7.p3.1">The Code Interpreter Plugin can be installed by ChatGPT Plus users in a few simple steps. However, it is worth noting that while this plugin is powerful, it does have certain limitations, such as frequent environment resets, limited Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities, and an inability to access the web. Despite these limitations, OpenAI continues to work on improving the capabilities of the Code Interpreter Plugin, promising a future with substantial impacts on the world of programming.</p></div>

<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx13.p4.1">I have very much seen this when playing with both my own "landmark attention" models, and Claude. I expect they will find a way round it at some point. Because humans write with a focus on the beginning and end of documents, so large language models pay far more attention at the beginning and end of their context input <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx387" title="">387</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx13.p5.1">That’s tricky because if you load in a stack of PDFs and they get translated by the system into one big chunk (which may or may not be in the expected order of the PDFs), then the PDFs in the middle of the submission are subject to more hallucination, garbling, forgetting etc.

Ask for references, ask if to tell you if it thinks it’s making it up, as for quotes, ask for locations, check the working, ask in many sperate ways etc.</p></div>

<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx13.p8.1">These "tips" can be encoded into the preamble that goes into every query, as a standing command, so you don’t have to, except for the checking bit of course.
You can do that with either self host models or the web ones, but it’s something you need to do often with the web interfaces. There’s no silver bullet yet but it feels like months away, so I am not advocating learning these tricks. Might be better to wait for the fixes. Just don’t trust them, these are the reasons, and they are all basically seeded in the way humans write.</p></div>

<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx14.p1.1">LoRA stands for Low-Rank Adaptation and it’s a cheap way to optimise models. A few hundred dollars of rented GPU time can nuance a model to be more performant for a specific task. It sounds great but basically you’re optimising for a task that you need to understand very well, possibly/probably to the detriment of the generality of the tool. If there’s something you know you want, then this is an option that’s achievable and affordable.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx14.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS8.SSSx14.p2.1">Goat, a 7B LLaMA model finetuned for arithmetic tasks notably outperformed the &nbsp;75x larger 540B PaLM model and GPT-4. Goat’s success can be attributed to two primary factors: task-specific finetuning and LLaMA’s unique digit tokenization. The problem here is Llama is arguably derived from data with a non-commercial license. OpenLlama gets around this with their Apache2 (do what you like) copy of the model. The situation is rapidly evolving. Another example of task-specific finetuning is the Gorilla project, where the LLM was trained to generate API calls. This is a really important area and we might be able to get ahead in this niche. This controlling complex whole site systems with voice control. The model was finetuned using 1,645 API calls from various sources and demonstrated superior performance compared to non-finetuned models. We can easily repeat that.</p></div>

<h6>Transformers</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx1.p1.1">Machine learning transformers are a groundbreaking architecture in the field of natural language processing (NLP) that have redefined tasks such as text generation, translation, and sentiment analysis. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZXFIhYczos679r70Yu8vV9uO6B1J0ztzeDxbnBxD1S0/edit#slide=id.g13dd67c5ab8_0_2648" title="">This link</a> is a very technical but excellent overview of how they work. Transformers have gained popularity due to their ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies and model complex relationships between words in a sentence.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx1.p2.1">At the core of the transformer architecture lies the self-attention mechanism. This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of each word in a sentence relative to the others, effectively capturing context and dependencies. In contrast to traditional neural networks, like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers process input sequences in parallel, rather than sequentially. This parallel processing enables transformers to efficiently understand and remember long-range dependencies, which is particularly important in NLP tasks.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx1.p3.1">RNNs, on the other hand, process input sequences one element at a time, making it difficult for them to capture relationships between words that are far apart in a sentence. As a result, RNNs can struggle with tasks that involve complex sentences or require a deep understanding of context.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx1.p4">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx1.p4.1">Transformer-based models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have become the go-to models for many NLP tasks.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx1.p5">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx1.p5.1">The layers contain weight matrices that are responsible for encoding the model’s knowledge and language understanding.</p></div>

<h6>GANs</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx2.p1.1">Generative adversarial networks are used for generating synthetic data, and are incredibly useful for our fine tuning use cases. GANs consist of two neural networks that are trained to compete with each other, with one network generating synthetic data and the other trying to distinguish between the synthetic data and real data. This process allows GANs to learn the underlying distribution of the data and generate samples that are highly realistic.</p></div>

<h6>LoRA</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx3.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx3.p1.1">LoRA, or Low-Rank Adaptation <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx391" title="">391</a>]</cite>, is a technique that enables efficient adaptation of large language models to specific tasks or domains while maintaining their expressive power. It does so by introducing a small modification to the pre-trained model’s weight matrices, enabling the fine-tuning process to be more computationally efficient without sacrificing performance. Visually you can think of this as slipping modification layers in between the transformer layers, which are far more interdependent and thereby expensive to retrain. We are already experimenting with these systems for our use cases.</p></div>

<h6>Embeddings and Latent Space</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx4.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx4.p1.1">Embeddings play a crucial role in both generative AI art and large language models, as they provide a way to represent complex data types, such as text or images, in a continuous vector space. In both contexts, embeddings capture the underlying structure and semantics of the input data, enabling AI models to learn and generate new content based on these representations. This is what the user sees happening with both AI generative art, and LLMs.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx4.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx4.p2.1">In the context of generative AI art, embeddings are often used to represent visual elements, such as images or shapes. Latent space is a continuous vector space where each point corresponds to an embedding that encodes the features and semantics of an image. Once the AI model is trained, new images can be generated by sampling points from this latent space and decoding them back into the image domain. Embeddings can similarly represent styles or artistic techniques. Style transfer techniques, for example, utilize embeddings to extract and apply the style of one image to the content of another.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx4.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx4.p3.1">In the context of large language models, embeddings are used to represent words, phrases, or sentences in a continuous vector space. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, learning to generate contextually relevant and semantically meaningful embeddings for language. Similarly to the visual use case in generative art these embeddings capture various aspects of language, such as syntax, semantics, and relationships between words or phrases.

<h6>Vector databases</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx5.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx5.p1.1">One of the highest points of human ‘friction’ when dealing with and AI model, and especially LLMs is the lack of a persistent and/or contextual memory within the systems. This is beginning to be addressed using vector databases.
A vector database is designed to efficiently store, manage, and query the high-dimensional vectors, often used in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence. These high-dimensional vectors are the embeddings previously discussed.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx5.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx5.p2.1">Using a vector database with embeddings for AI data retrieval and processing can significantly improve efficiency, scalability, and performance. In the context of a stored item of data, embeddings allow the storage of complex ‘concepts’ as fixed-length vector, which interacts with the enormous latent space in the trained model. This makes storage and retrieval more efficient.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx5.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx5.p3.1">Vector databases allow and optimise for efficient nearest neighbor search, which is crucial for data retrieval tasks in AI applications.
To do this, given a query input, the AI system first converts the input into an embedding using the same technique as for the stored data. The vector database then performs a nearest neighbour search to find the most similar embeddings in the database. At scale this can result in more consistency when using models, but crucially it doesn’t train the models on events that have happened. It is not a ‘memory’.</p></div>

This is a pretty stunning paper for our purposes in collaborative XR where we would hope to interact with virtual agents.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx6.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx6.p2.1">As they point out in the paper virtual agents should be able to manage constantly-growing memories and handle cascading social dynamics that unfold between multiple agents. Their architecture uses a large language model to generate a memory stream, reflection, and planning. The memory stream contains a comprehensive list of the agent’s experiences (written as a kind of internal monologue), and the planning module synthesizes higher-level inferences over time. These memory transcriptions are highly compressible and would be excellent as RGB style private data blobs between our federated virtual worlds. It will therefore me possible to ‘meet’ virtual agent friends across instances of virtual spaces <span id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx6.p2.1.1">and</span> through nostr social media.

<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx7.p1.1">Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning and deep learning, including large language models, to minimize a loss function. The loss function measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output (also known as the target) for a given input. The goal of the training process is to <a href="https://societyofai.medium.com/gradient-descent-basics-and-application-1cef98179ee6" title="">minimize this loss</a> to improve the model’s performance.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx7.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx7.p2.1">In the context of large language models, gradient descent helps to adjust the model’s parameters (weights and biases) so that it can generate more accurate predictions. These models consist of multiple layers of neurons with a large number of parameters that need to be fine-tuned.

These methods differ in how they use the training data to compute the gradients and update the parameters. In SGD, the gradients are computed and the parameters are updated using only one data point at a time, while in mini-batch gradient descent, a small batch of data points is used to compute the gradients and update the parameters. LLMs like GPT can use meta optimisers to train as they operate <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx393" title="">393</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

<h6>Latent space</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx12.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx12.p1.1">In the context of generative artificial intelligence (AI), a latent space is a high-dimensional space in which the model represents data as points. This space is "latent" because it is not directly observed, but is inferred by the model based on the data it is trained on. In the case of a generative model, the latent space is often used to encode the underlying structure of the data, such that samples can be generated by sampling from the latent space and then decoding them into the data space.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx12.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx12.p2.1">For example, in a generative model for images, the latent space may encode the features or characteristics of the image, such as the shape, color, and texture. By sampling from this latent space and decoding the sample, the model can generate new images that are similar to the training data, but are not exact copies. This allows the model to generate novel and diverse samples that capture the essence of the training data.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx12.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS9.SSSx12.p3.1">The latent space is an important aspect of generative models because it allows the model to capture the underlying structure of the data in a compact and efficient way. It also provides a way to control the generation process, such as by interpolating between latent space points to generate smooth transitions between samples. At this time the navigation through that mathematical space is steered by vectors into the space, which come from a separate and parallel integration of a natural language model. This crucial bridge came from research at OpenAI, and has been instrumental in the current explosion of usability of the systems <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx394" title="">394</a>]</cite>.</p></div>

In short, is it the case that these models are not, and will never be, the kind of things that can understand? Or conversely, 2) do these systems (or will their near-term successors) actually, even in the absence of physical experience, create something like the rich concept-based mental models that are central to human understanding, and, if so, does scaling these models create ever better concepts? Or, 3) if these systems do not create such concepts, can their unimaginably large systems of statistical correlations produce abilities that are functionally equivalent to human understanding? Or, indeed, that enable new forms of higher-order logic that humans are incapable of accessing? And at this point will it still make sense to call such correlations “spurious” or the resulting solutions “shortcuts?” And would it make sense to see the systems’ behavior not as “competence without comprehension” but as a new, nonhuman form of understanding? These questions are no longer in the realm of abstract philosophical discussions but touch on very real concerns about the capabilities, robustness, safety, and ethics of AI systems that increasingly play roles in humans’ everyday lives.”</span></p></div>

<h6>ChatGPT</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx1.p1.1">ChatGPT is a neural network-based natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI. It is a continuation of the OpenAI programme which binds iteratively more capable Generative Pre-trained Transformer models to a web and API based text chat interface. It uses self-attention mechanisms to generate high-quality text in a variety of different languages. ChatGPT is specifically designed for conversational text generation, and has been trained on a large corpus of dialogue data in order to produce responses that are natural, diverse, and relevant to a given conversation. Because it is a large language model, ChatGPT has a vast amount of knowledge and can generate responses to a wide range of questions and prompts and meta-prompts <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx396" title="">396</a>]</cite>. This allows it to generate responses that are relevant, natural-sounding, and diverse in nature. It has proved incredibly popular, demonstrating uncanny abilities for natural conversation, code generation, copy writing and more. It is substantially flawed in that it ‘speaks’ with authority but often makes things up completely. This extended recently to creating academic references to back it’s assertions, completely out of thin air. The interface and APIs seem to be evolving and improving in real time.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx1.p2.1">The model uses a transformer-based architecture, which means that it consists of a series of interconnected “blocks” that process the input data and generate the output text. Each block contains multiple self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on different aspects of the input data and generate a response that is coherent and relevant to the conversation. In addition to its transformer-based architecture, ChatGPT also uses a variety of other techniques to improve its performance. For example, it uses beam search to generate multiple candidate responses for each input, and then selects the best one based on a combination of factors such as relevance, coherence, and diversity. This allows the model to generate high-quality responses that are appropriate for a given conversation. Additionally, ChatGPT uses a technique called “response conditioning” to bias the model towards generating responses that are appropriate for a given conversation context. This allows the model to generate more relevant and coherent responses, even when faced with challenging input data. Microsoft have <a href="https://medium.com/@owenyin/scoop-oh-the-things-youll-do-with-bing-s-chatgpt-62b42d8d7198" title="">integrated GPT4</a> with Bing, their internet search engine, and plugins for other websites are coming soon.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx1.p3.1">One key aspect of GPT-4 is reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which helps align the model with human preferences, making it more useful and easier to interact with. The process involves using human feedback to fine-tune the model, requiring relatively less data compared to the initial training phase. The development of GPT-4 involves multiple components: the design of neural network algorithms, data selection, and human supervision through RLHF. Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the behavior of the fully trained system using evaluation processes, although the complete understanding of the model remains a challenge. GPT-4 has the ability to perform ‘reasoning’ based on the knowledge it has gained from the training data. While some interactions with the model may display wisdom, others might lack it. The dialog format used in the model enables it to answer follow-up questions, admit mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. In a recent report, researchers revealed groundbreaking advancements in GPT-4, hinting at sparks of artificial general intelligence <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx397" title="">397</a>]</cite>. The Microsoft researchers had access to the unrestrained GPT-4 during its early development, allowing them to experiment for around six months.</p><ul id="Ch8.S2.I26">

</ul>
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx1.p3.2">There are obviously still limitations to GPT-4. As an autoregressive model, it cannot plan ahead and struggles with discontinuous tasks. This issue could potentially be addressed by augmenting language models with external memory. The paper raises concerns about the unrestricted GPT-4’s ability to create propaganda and conspiracy theories, and the ethical implications of giving AI intrinsic motivation. The researchers call for a better understanding of AI systems like GPT-4 to address these challenges.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx1.p4">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx1.p4.1">When asked about controversial figures or topics, GPT-4 can provide nuanced and balanced answers, highlighting its potential to reintroduce nuance to conversations. It is important to consider AI safety and alignment when developing powerful models like GPT-4. After its completion, the model underwent extensive internal and external testing, including red teaming and safety evaluations, to ensure alignment with human values. To ensure that AI systems align with various human values, it is necessary to establish broad societal boundaries, which may differ across countries and individual users. The art of crafting effective prompts for GPT-4 involves understanding the model’s behavior and composing prompts in a way that elicits the desired response. This process is similar to human conversation, where individuals adapt their phrasing to communicate more effectively. As the model becomes more advanced, it may increasingly resemble human interactions, which can offer insights into human communication and behaviour.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx1.p5">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx1.p5.1">Although impressive, it is generally agreed that GPT-4 is not an AGI due to its limitations in approximating human-level intelligence. The concept of consciousness in AI is debated, with some believing AI can be conscious, while others argue that AI can convincingly fake consciousness without being truly aware. Potential risks associated with even a ‘simply’ and unconcious AI include disinformation, economic shocks, and geopolitical impacts. These concerns do not necessarily require superintelligence but could result from large-scale deployment of powerful language models without proper safety controls.</p></div>

The impact of AI systems like GPT-4 on programming is significant, changing the way programmers work by allowing an iterative process and back-and-forth dialogue with the AI as a creative partner. This development is seen as a major step forward in programming.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx2.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS11.SSSx2.p2.1">It seems almost inevitable that at some stage a large language model will be optimised for computer instruction sets, and simply be able to bridge directly from human intentionality to bytecode, running it’s own tests and refinements without external consultation. The degree to which this would still be considered ‘a compiler’ is unclear.</p></div>

This might enable the generation of photorealistic images, high-resolution videos, and detailed 3D geometry for various applications, so it’s certainly something to watch closely. Our alignment to self hosted and open source pipelines makes this less of a priority for exploration however.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS13.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS13.p3.1">Companies like Getty Images and Shutterstock intend to use Picasso for building generative models with their extensive libraries.

<div id="Ch8.S2.SS13.p4">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS13.p4.1">In the field of biology, Nvidia’s Clara could be a healthcare application framework for imaging instruments, genomics, and drug discovery. Their Bio NeMo might help researchers create fine-tuned custom models with proprietary data. Nvidia BioNeMo service could provide generative AI models for drug discovery as a cloud service for easy access to accelerated workflows.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS13.p5">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS13.p5.1">As discussed Nvidia still hope that their enterprise metaverse offering Onmiverse will gain worldwide traction. They are investing heavily in bringing ML into this product line. This is an incrediby similar proposition to flossvers, our proposal in this book, but operating at a different level of investment and technology, with commensurately more gated access.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS13.p6">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS13.p6.1">Nvidia’s partnerships with TSMC, ASML, and Synopsys could lead to advancements in chips and efficiency. Grace, Grace Hopper, and Bluefield 3 are designed for energy-efficient accelerated data centers.</p></div>

<p id="Ch8.S2.SS13.p7.1">Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI and especially ChatGPT is clearly paying dividends right now, but it is possible that they are mindful of the transition to less centrally controlled ‘edge’ hardware as previously mentioned has forced their hand toward offering their generalised systems for use by corporations as plugins.

Their plugin ‘code interpreter’ allows uploading of data files of up to 100MBin size, and both writing and execution of Python code, one of the languages of data analystics. This toolkit is the first major leveraging of a unified multi-modal model. It can create media rich documents with charts, images, and diagrams, providing appropriate descriptive analysis and diagnostics of the statistics employed.

The paper presents FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for large language models (LLMs) that can be run with a single commodity GPU. FlexGen can be configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk, and it uses a linear programming optimizer to store and access tensors. FlexGen compresses weights and attention key/value cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss, allowing for a larger batch size and increased throughput.

<p id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx2.p2.1">To apply NMT to text interfaces in the metaverse, the algorithm can be integrated into the interface itself. When a user types text in a specific language, the NMT algorithm can automatically detect the language and generate a translation in the desired language. This can be done in real-time, allowing for fast and seamless communication between users speaking different languages. NMT algorithms are well-suited for use in text interfaces, allowing for fast and accurate translations between multiple languages.

<p id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx3.p4.1">One of the key references for the use of neural machine translation in real-time language translation is the paper "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate" by Bahdanau et al <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx399" title="">399</a>]</cite>. This paper describes the use of a neural network-based approach to machine translation, which has shown impressive results in terms of accuracy and speed.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx3.p5">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx3.p5.1">One of the key advantages of NMT is its ability to handle complex and varied sentences. Traditional translation algorithms often rely on fixed rules and dictionaries, which can be limiting. NMT algorithms, on the other hand, can learn to handle a wide range of sentence structures and vocabulary. This makes them well-suited for translating natural languages, which are often full of irregularities and exceptions.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx3.p6">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx3.p6.1">Another advantage of NMT is its ability to handle multiple languages at once. Traditional translation algorithms often require the user to specify the source and target languages, but NMT algorithms can automatically detect the languages of the input and output text. This makes them well-suited for use in metaverse applications, where users may be speaking different languages at the same time.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx3.p7">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx3.p7.1">One of the challenges of using NMT in metaverse applications is the need for real-time performance. Metaverse applications often involve fast-paced interactions, and any delay in language translation can hinder the user experience. To overcome this challenge, NMT algorithms can be optimized for speed, using techniques such as parallel processing and batching. It seems likely that in our proposed systems we will require API calls to external services for this functionality, and this will almost certainly incur a cost.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx3.p8">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx3.p8.1">The use of NMT in metaverse applications is also an active area of research, with a number of papers exploring the potential of this technology. For example, the paper "Real-Time Neural Machine Translation for Virtual Reality" by Chen et al. describes the use of NMT algorithms in virtual reality environments, showing how they can be used to support real-time communication between users speaking different languages.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx3.p9">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS14.SSSx3.p9.1">Overall, the use of machine learning for real-time language translation is a rapidly-evolving field, with many exciting developments and applications. As the technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more impressive results and applications in the future.

<div id="Ch8.S2.SS17.SSSx3.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS17.SSSx3.p1.1">Autonomous General Purpose Language Models (AutoGPTs) are tools that can perform any task, leveraging connection to the internet and LLMs. Recently there has been a shift in the AutoGPT space towards specialized agents that cater to specific tasks or industries, providing more focused and useful solutions. This represents part of a more general move away from centralised general models toward more task specific systems.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS17.SSSx3.p2">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS17.SSSx3.p2.1">Autonomous agents for research for instance search the internet for information relevant to a specific research topic and extract information from trustworthy sources. One example is [insert], an agent designed explicitly for research purposes. Similarly, medical research agents can call medical APIs and cite sources, providing targeted assistance in the medical field.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS17.SSSx3.p3">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS17.SSSx3.p3.1">These agents can leverage a chain of GPT calls and fine-tuned models to perform tasks efficiently and effectively.</p></div>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS17.SSSx3.p4">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS17.SSSx3.p4.1">It has been suggested that such systems be dubbed semi-autonomous specialized agents (SASAs). These agents can streamline processes, automating multiple steps without requiring user mediation for each task. It can be seen that these are already being integrated with messenger services such as Telegram bots, very similarly to the planning and approach seen in this book.

<h6>Governance in the Virtual Reality Space</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS18.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS18.SSSx1.p1.1">The governance of the virtual world will be a critical element in the success of the Metaverse. The virtual world will need to be policed and governed in a way that will not only protect the rights of the citizens of this new digital environment but also protect them from cybercrime. As a somewhat strained but interesting example; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/interpol-says-metaverse-opens-up-new-world-cybercrime-2022-10-27/" title="">Interpol see</a> simulated environments as a way for terrorist groups to gather and plan attack. Governments and regulatory bodies will play a key role in the governance of the virtual world, but so will the industry and businesses. Nair et al describe the “unprecedented privacy risks” of the metaverse, finding that wearing a headset can currently reveal 25 data points about the user, simply by analysis of the data <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx401" title="">401</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx402" title="">402</a>]</cite>. This included inference about ethnicity, disability, and economic status. Strong data protection laws will be needed to safeguard privacy, data ownership and reduce the risk of data breaches. The governance of the virtual world will be critical to success, safeguarding will be needed to protect citizens from cyberattacks.</p></div>

<h6>Safeguarding in the Metaverse</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS18.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS18.SSSx2.p1.1">When it comes to safeguarding in the Metaverse, people need to be made aware of the risk of using VR technology. There are still many questions around the health implications of using VR and the impact it may have on a person’s eyesight. In terms of safeguarding in the Metaverse, this is just one area that needs to be addressed. Users will also need to be made aware of the risks of hacking. Users will need to be educated on the need to be careful when it comes to sharing personal information and be careful what websites they access on a virtual computer. They will need to be made aware of the potential risk of having malware installed on their computer by visiting untrusted websites. Users will also need to be made aware of the potential risk of being manipulated in the virtual world. This risk is particularly high when it comes to children who are growing up in the digital world. They will need to be educated on the potential risks of being groomed or manipulated in the Metaverse.

<h6>How to fight against cybercrime in the Metaverse?</h6>
<div id="Ch8.S2.SS18.SSSx3.p1">
<p id="Ch8.S2.SS18.SSSx3.p1.1">The best way to fight against cybercrime in the Metaverse is to educate the general public on the potential risks and dangers in order to prevent them from being targeted. This can be done through various channels and mediums, such as social media, blogs and podcasts. People will need to be made aware of the risks of opening emails or clicking on links sent by unknown people. They will also need to be aware of the risks of clicking on ads and links that may lead them to websites that host malware or that steal personal information.</p></div>

<h3>
<span>Chapter 9 </span>Affecting global change</h3>
<div id="Ch9.p1">
<p id="Ch9.p1.1">In his latest book, Runciman, professor of Politics at Cambridge University, traces contemporary anxieties about artificial intelligence back centuries to the origins of the modern state and corporation. There are interesting an striking parallels between the apparatus of state, and the emergent field of AI.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.p2">
<p id="Ch9.p2.1">In the 17th century, Thomas Hobbes described the ideal state as a kind of "automaton" - a human-made machine that could provide stability and security beyond fickle, emotional human politics. Later, the invention of the limited liability corporation allowed artificial entities to take on previously unthinkable risks and debts. Runciman argues that states and corporations function essentially as “robots” - artificial, human-made creations constructed to make decisions and take actions. Much like our worries about AI today, these entities were designed to take over certain tasks and responsibilities from human hands.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.p3">
<p id="Ch9.p3.1">States and corporations have acquired immense, sometimes unchecked power, persisting and protecting themselves as emergent features of their creation. They remain fundamentally inhuman; they do not think, feel, or have a conscience as individual humans do. Runciman suggests that the story of the modern world is the story of handing over decision-making and control to these robots, AI and systemic alike.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.p4">
<p id="Ch9.p4.1">Today, our prosperity, health, and safety depend deeply on these state and corporate machines. Yet Runciman warns they could also lead to catastrophe if we fail to maintain control. Their vast powers, from mass surveillance to nuclear weapons, remind us of their inhuman, robotic nature. Runciman argues we must focus not just on regulating new AI, but on democratizing and improving oversight over existing state and corporate "robots" we rely upon daily. More transparency, public input, and innovation in governance is needed to retain human agency. Though we created them, these powerful machines can take on a life of their own.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.p5">
<p id="Ch9.p5.1">This chapter attempts to speak to these issues, and the wider global need to reassert control over the human condition. We will start by looking at global economics, then talk briefly about the global approaches to AI which are emerging, before exploring AI in detail in it’s own chapter.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.p6">
<p id="Ch9.p6.1">Malone, an ex central banking analyst now working in crypto, links across the last two chapters of blockchain, and money, <a href="https://twitter.com/brendanpmalone/status/1628067806984937472" title="">in a Twitter thread</a>. He believes that policymakers should focus on the underlying problems in the financial system, rather than just focusing on crypto. He has a lot of appreciation for US policymakers worrying about risk in the financial system. Crypto gets attention because it’s an easy target, but Malone believes that the real problems are so much bigger. According to Malone, people want to hold USD money to store value and make payments. Most are familiar with cash and bank deposits, but there’s actually a spectrum of assets of varying quality that act like money, as we saw in the previous chapter. These include Euro dollars, repo, commercial paper, and more. This is what people are talking about when they reference the shadow banking system - money moving around the financial system outside of traditional banks, primarily in non-banks. As an aside, the name ‘euro dollar’ predates the Euro currency, and has nothing to do with it. The origins of the eurodollar market can be attributed to the Cold War in the 1950s. At that time, the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies began depositing their US dollar holdings in European banks, primarily in London, to avoid the risk of their assets being frozen by the US government. These dollar-denominated deposits held outside the United States became known as eurodollars. Malone notes that some amount of shadow banking activity is good because it allows the money supply to be more reactive and expand and contract with economic activity, which helps fuel economic growth. However, the regulatory and political apparatus and the underlying systems weren’t really designed for a system this large, opaque, and multi-dimensional. This was seen in 2008 and 2009, which was as much about shadow banking and financial plumbing as it was about subprime housing and complex derivatives. The same was seen in 2020 with COVID-19.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.p7">
<p id="Ch9.p7.1">In times of crisis, people want to be able to freely convert whatever they are holding into something safer on the spectrum. Sadly, sometimes market liquidity isn’t there, so the central banks and come to save the day, and this kicks the can down the road. The core issue is that people an institutions want to store capital in places they can’t access due to technical, institutional, or geopolitical reasons. Sovereigns hold US treasuries, hedge funds and HRTs use repo, and we have seen that the crypto and Bitcoin economies have stablecoins.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.p8">
<p id="Ch9.p8.1">Since 2008 and 2009, the Treasury Market has gotten significantly larger, more fragile, and more complex. Banks have even more restrictions on creating deposits, and the demand for safe assets keeps skyrocketing. On top of that, the geopolitical landscape has changed dramatically, with US sanctions and seizure of Russian USD assets. Malone notes that crypto is a response to these underlying problems. Although it is not perfect, it is getting better as people learn from past experiences and begin to build regulatory clarity. This issue of regulatory clarity leads us into this section of the book, which looks are implicit or explicit corruption of governance.&nbsp;As a uueful example; The New York Magazine article provided an in-depth interview with Gary Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in which he shared his thoughts on the cryptocurrency industry. One of the key takeaways was his belief that all cryptocurrencies, except for Bitcoin, should be considered securities, as they involve relying on the work of others to give them value. Gensler is an ex banker, and an ambitious politician, with his eyes on bigger prizes. He openly courted the attention of the now disgraced top team at FTX which failed so spectacularly. His assertions have sparked controversy, as it raises questions about the feasibility of registering all tokens as securities, given the unique challenges posed by open-source protocols and the changing nature of blockchain technologies. Critics argue that Gensler’s stance could harm innovation and capital formation, as companies and entrepreneurs may struggle to comply with onerous regulations or abandon their projects altogether. The current system simply doesn’t fit this new self forming marketplace, and his implication seems to be that the legal end game here is the destruction of the invested capital, because of non compliance. This has led to frustration and concern among crypto advocates and investors, who worry about the impact of such policies on the industry’s growth and development.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.p9">
<p id="Ch9.p9.1">The discourse should be on the much more fundamental questions of the monetary system and fragility of past assumptions and their ability to predict what comes next. Even as these conversations happen, however, the Bitcoin and stable coin builders will keep building because they are not going to sit around and wait for solutions to be presented to them.</p></div>

After steadily rising between 1600 to 1913, Britain’s wealth as a share of the global total peaked and then began falling until the end of the 1970s [ref required]. During this time, Britain became one of Europe’s most equal countries, even without the support of its Empire [ref needed]. Some argue this relative equality enabled Britain’s economic growth and international standing to keep pace with its European neighbours, despite the loss of imperial power [ref needed]. During this period there was much upheaval in global monetary systems. More recently we have seen that trust has diminished, and inequality has risen, with social media perhaps acting as an accelerator.</p></div>

<div id="Ch9.S1.SS2.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS2.p1.1">Four decades later, the social impacts of rising inequality are becoming clear. Of the 14 million people living in poverty in Britain today, most are in working families [ref needed]. Upward mobility is declining, as the continued dominance of the privately educated elite in top jobs hinders meritocracy [The Gender Wage Gap Among University Vice Chancellors in the UK

<p id="Ch9.S1.SS4.p1.1">Dorling [oxford, reference] Tackling inequality requires recognizing that excessive wealth concentration is detrimental to social cohesion and national prosperity. A modicum of inequality may be inevitable, but the widening chasm between rich and poor in Britain has passed sustainable limits. With common purpose and political will, a more equitable path is possible. As inequality lessened for decades before, supportive policies enabled the rise of a thriving middle class [The Persistence in Gendering: Work-Family Policy in Britain since Beveridge

<span>9.1.5 </span>Anacyclosis</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS5.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS5.p1.1">It’s interesting in the current global political moment to look briefly at Anacyclosis. This is a political theory attributed to the ancient Greek historian Polybius, which posits that political systems evolve in a cyclical manner. The theory is based on the observation that governments tend to progress through six stages, each corresponding to a specific form of governance: monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and ochlocracy (mob rule). These stages are organized into three pairs, with each pair consisting of a ’good’ form of governance and its corresponding ’bad’ form.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS5.p2">
<ul id="Ch9.S1.I1">
<li id="Ch9.S1.I1.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch9.S1.I1.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.I1.i1.p1.1">Monarchy (benign) -&gt; Tyranny (corrupt): Monarchy is the rule by a single individual, such as a king or queen, who is considered to be a wise and benevolent ruler. However, as the monarchy endures, there is a risk that the ruler becomes corrupted or that a less competent or tyrannical successor takes over. This leads to tyranny, the degenerate form of monarchy, where the ruler becomes oppressive and self-serving.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch9.S1.I1.i2">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch9.S1.I1.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.I1.i2.p1.1">Aristocracy (benign) -&gt; Oligarchy (corrupt): To counter the tyranny, a group of nobles or elites may overthrow the tyrant and establish an aristocracy, which is the rule by a select group of individuals who are considered wise and virtuous. Over time, the aristocracy may become more focused on their own interests and power, leading to an oligarchy. This is the degenerate form of aristocracy, where a small group of elites control the government for their own benefit.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch9.S1.I1.i3">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch9.S1.I1.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.I1.i3.p1.1">Democracy (benign) -&gt; Ochlocracy (corrupt): The populace, dissatisfied with the oppressive rule of the oligarchs, may rise up and establish a democracy, which is the rule by the majority of the people through voting and participation in the political process. Democracy has the potential to create a fair and representative system of governance. However, as the democratic process becomes more susceptible to demagoguery, populism, and factionalism, it can devolve into ochlocracy or mob rule, where the government is influenced or controlled by unruly masses.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS5.p2.1">According to Polybius, these stages form a continuous cycle, as one form of governance gives way to another, and each form eventually becomes corrupted and degenerates into its corresponding ’bad’ form. The theory of anacyclosis suggests that political systems are inherently unstable, with each form of governance containing the seeds of its own destruction.</p></div>

<span>9.1.6 </span>The World Economic Forum</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p1.1">The World Economic Forum (WEF) is a non-governmental organization founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab. It is well known for its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where world leaders, CEOs, and various stakeholders gather to discuss global issues and potential solutions. Although the WEF does not have direct control over policymaking, its influence on global policy arises from its role as a platform for dialogue and idea exchange, as well as its ability to bring together influential individuals.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p2">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p2.1">As unelected technocrats, the WEF’s impact on global policy can be observed through these aspects:
</p><ul id="Ch9.S1.I2">
<li id="Ch9.S1.I2.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch9.S1.I2.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.I2.i1.p1.1">Convening power: The WEF’s Davos meeting is a high-profile event that attracts prominent political figures, business executives, and other influential individuals. This ability to assemble people allows the WEF to initiate conversations on global issues, create networks, and establish connections among key players. These interactions can lead to ideas and initiatives that might eventually shape global policy.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch9.S1.I2.i2">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch9.S1.I2.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.I2.i2.p1.1">Knowledge sharing and thought leadership: The WEF produces a range of publications, reports, and research that provide insights into various global challenges. By disseminating this knowledge, the WEF contributes to the broader understanding of complex issues and helps to inform policymaking by governments, businesses, and other organizations.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch9.S1.I2.i3">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch9.S1.I2.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.I2.i3.p1.1">Agenda-setting: Through its conferences and publications, the WEF identifies and highlights emerging trends, risks, and opportunities, which can help to set the agenda for global policy discussions. By bringing attention to specific issues, the WEF can indirectly influence the priorities of governments and other decision-makers.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch9.S1.I2.i4">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch9.S1.I2.i4.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.I2.i4.p1.1">Public-private cooperation: The WEF actively promotes collaboration between the public and private sectors in addressing global challenges. By fostering partnerships and facilitating dialogue between these sectors, the WEF can help drive the development and implementation of policies that require cooperation between governments, businesses, and civil society.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p2.2">Despite its influence, critics argue that the WEF’s position as unelected technocrats raises concerns about the organization’s legitimacy and accountability. They contend that the WEF’s ability to shape global policy without being directly answerable to citizens can undermine democratic processes and result in policies that prioritize the interests of elites over the broader public. However, others argue that the WEF’s role in facilitating dialogue and collaboration is essential for tackling complex global challenges that require coordinated action across sectors and borders.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p3">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p3.1">Interesting for us the WEF recently released its annual <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf" title="">Global Risks Report</a>, which highlights various threats and challenges facing the world today, and which intersect with all of the narratives in this book. The report discusses issues related to cybersecurity, public trust, and social cohesion, and underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to addressing these challenges.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p4">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p4.1">The WEF’s founder, Klaus Schwab, has previously argued for a “great reset” in society and the economy, which involves revamping various aspects of our lives, from education to social contracts and working conditions. This reset would require the construction of new foundations for economic and social systems.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p5">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p5.1">The WEF Global Risks Report 2022 focuses on five main categories, which are also part of their “Great Narrative for Humankind” initiative:</p><ul id="Ch9.S1.I3">
<li id="Ch9.S1.I3.i1">

<li id="Ch9.S1.I3.i5">
<span>•</span>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p5.2">The report emphasizes that the erosion of social cohesion has been a significant global issue since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. In addressing these challenges, the WEF suggests that public-private collaborations are necessary to ensure effective decision-making and to safeguard the future of humanity.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p6">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p6.1">The report also highlights the increasing digital dependency that intensifies cyberthreats, as the WEF has long warned of the potential for a significant cyber pandemic. The rapid spread of a cyber attack with “COVID-like characteristics” could potentially cause more damage than any biological virus.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p7">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p7.1">The WEF Global Risks Report 2022 delves further into the potential consequences of a cyber pandemic. In a section titled “Shocks to Reflect Upon” the report explores the possibility of a wide-ranging and costly attack that could lead to cascading failures in systemically important businesses and disrupt services, ultimately undermining digital transformation efforts made in recent year.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p8">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p8.1">The report also emphasizes the need for governments to address cyberthreats and warns that without mitigation, the escalation of cyberwarfare and the disruption of societies could result in a loss of trust in governments’ ability to act as digital stewards.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p9">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p9.1">To better understand the risks associated with technology, the WEF report explores the concept of the fourth industrial revolution, which Schwab believes will lead to the fusion of our physical, biological, and digital identities. This fusion will be facilitated by technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of things-enabled devices, edge computing, blockchain, and 5G. You can see they’re examining similar things to this book.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p10">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p10.1">As explaining in this work, these technologies present numerous opportunities for businesses and societies, they also expose users to elevated and more pernicious forms of digital and cyber risk. The report also discusses the potential emergence of the metaverse, which could create new vulnerabilities for malicious actors by increasing the number of entry points for malware and data breaches, again a central theme of this text.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p11">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p11.1">In light of these risks, the WEF report suggests that users will need to navigate security vulnerabilities inherent in complex technologies characterized by decentralization and a lack of structured guardrails or sophisticated onboarding infrastructure.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p12">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p12.1">The report also touches on the issue of digital identity as we do. They view digital identity is a crucial component of accessing products, services, and information in a digital world, but again, this raises concerns about privacy, security, and the potential for misuse.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p13">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p13.1">Finally, the WEF Global Risks Report 2022 addresses the issue of public trust, noting that the growth of deepfakes and disinformation-for-hire can deepen mistrust between societies, businesses, and governments. We can already see this starting to happen as Musk’s defence lawyers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/27/elon-musks-statements-could-be-deepfakes-tesla-defence-lawyers-tell-court" title="">point to possible deepfake use</a> around video comments he is alleged to have made with regard to Tesla’s software safety. To rebuild trust and social cohesion, the report calls for leaders to adopt new models, look long term, renew cooperation, and act systemically. Quite what they think they can do in the face of images like the recent memes of the Pope is unclear <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch9.F1" title="Figure 9.1 ‣ 9.1.6 The World Economic Forum ‣ 9.1 Global politics &amp; digital society ‣ Chapter 9 Affecting global change ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>9.1</span></a> .</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p14">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS6.p14.1">It’s absolutely crucial to note that the WEF is a powerful organisation, with global sway over policy, and is an enormous concentration of power in the hands of unelected technocrats. The authors are very sceptical of the WEF, but this report highlights what both technocrats and policy makers are thinking.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>9.1.7 </span>Money and The State</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p1.1">It seems a pretty reasonable that the best ‘systemic’ approach is a separation between major centralising forces such as state, church, and money. In practice we can see that globally, this isn’t the case, with bad hotspots of high corruption where all three meld together into kleptocratic dictatorships, or theocracies. For our purposes in the UK it’s useful to look at the concept of ‘austerity’.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p2">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p2.1">Austerity is a term used to describe a set of economic policies that aim to reduce government spending and debt, often through cuts to public services and welfare programs. The concept of austerity has its origins in the 1920s, following the end of World War I and the economic crisis that ensued. In the wake of the war, many Western European countries were struggling with high levels of debt and inflation. In response, governments began implementing policies to reduce spending and balance their budgets.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p3">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p3.1">We have seen in the previous chapter that the concept of inflation itself is complex, and somewhat argued about still. Globally, on aggregate, the efficiencies of increasing technology are thought to be deflationary to the tune of between 3 and 5 percent annually, though this may radically spike up in the era of AI which will be covered later. This is counter to the current need for inflation to maintain debt repayments at a national level. Central banks manipulate interest rates to control inflation, aiming to keep it at sustainable levels. This process is necessary because as national debt and deficits grow, governments need inflation to prevent these debts from spiraling out of control. Higher inflation results in higher nominal GDP, which in turn increases the tax base, providing governments with the revenue needed to pay down debt. To achieve this. The natural progression of humanity inherently deflationary, which forces central banks to print more money and further manipulate the monetary system in order to generate the desired inflation. This can be seen as a hidden tax on citizens, as it devalues their money over time. The negative effects of this system are disproportionately felt by lower-income groups. As inflation rises, the cost of living increases, and many households struggle to make ends meet. This has led to a situation where households need multiple incomes to maintain their standard of living, forcing individuals to work longer hours and take on multiple jobs. As a result, people have less free time and energy to engage in rewarding activities or spend time with their families. This need for constant economic growth, as measured by GDP, has led to an environment where individuals are pushed to be more productive at the expense of their well-being. This has resulted in a society where many people are overworked and struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living. Booth discussed this at length in his book ‘The Price of Tomorrow’. His is a rare thesis based around the ideas that technology is deflationary, that the marginal cost of goods trends over zero over time, and that the current system of debt and inflation are inherently unsustainable in the face of exponential technology improvements and automation. We discuss the concept of inflation and deflation, and both their risks throughout the book, but Booth has been very clear on this for many years. He thinks the current global monetary system ill-suited to handle the challenges and opportunities presented by deflation. He suggests that embracing deflation is the key to unlocking a prosperous and sustainable future. The book delves into the implications of deflation on various aspects of society, including wealth distribution, job markets, and the role of governments in shaping economic policies. <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx138" title="">138</a>]</cite>.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p4">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p4.1">In the 1920s, Keynes was one of the first to argue against the austerity measures which seem part of the cyclical playbook around debt and inflation. He argued that that cutting government spending during a recession would only worsen the economic downturn. Instead, he advocated for increased government spending to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment. Despite this, many governments continued to implement austerity policies throughout the 1920s and 1930s.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p5">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p5.1">In the post-World War II period, the rise of the welfare state and the adoption of Keynesian economic policies led to a shift away from austerity in many countries. However, in the 1970s, a new economic crisis led to a resurgence of austerity policies, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom. In the 1980s, the rise of neoliberalism and the influence of economists such as Milton Friedman led to further cuts to government spending and the rolling back of the welfare state.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p6">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p6.1">Today, the concept of austerity continues to shape economic policy, particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Many governments, particularly in Europe, have implemented austerity measures in response to the crisis, leading to cuts to public services and welfare programs. The effectiveness of these policies remains a contentious issue, with some arguing that they have helped to reduce debt and stabilize economies, while others argue that they have led to increased inequality and hindered economic growth. Looking around at the state of the world, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor, it is possible to have some sympathy with those who see patterns in the bahaviour of political leaders and the controllers of Western capital and global resources. The system seems engineered to reward a few. It is possible to view ‘austerity’ as a means of political control of economic levers, in order to de-democratise populations. This mantra of ‘do more, consume less’ has perhaps become a defacto methodology to constrain popular ideas, diverting capital back into the hands of incumbents, land owners, and the politically and economically motivated <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx139" title="">139</a>]</cite>. It seems that the controlling nexus of this political framework globally is the concept of the central bank, unelected technocrats whose tenures span across political administrations. Again, this can be traced back to the 1920’s. Hawtrey’s 1925 “Currency &amp; Public Administration” asserts that a central bank should <span id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p6.1.1">“Never explain; never regret; never apologise.”</span>, and speaks glowingly of the selfish market <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx140" title="">140</a>]</cite>. This economic model is referred to as Dirigisme and feels increasingly the global norm <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx141" title="">141</a>]</cite>. We can perhaps here see the divergent point at which the lionization of the market began. Again, to be clear, the authors are not economists, but it does seem that in a global digital society there is room to explore more equitable models of global value, governance, and trust.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p7">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p7.1">Remember that these centrally planned national and global actions provide liquidity to the private banking sector. Like the digital money analogues discussed earlier in the book private banks operate fractional reserve banking. This is a banking system where banks hold only a fraction of the deposits they receive as reserves, while the rest is lent out to customers. This means that the money supply in an economy can be increased through the lending activities of banks (itself a complex inflationary force which devalues money over time, feeding back into the policy directives of the central banks. The fractional reserve system is useful for capital creation in times of growth, but relies on the confidence of the depositors.

<p id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p9.1">It’s interesting that Brett, a former FDIC regulator <a href="https://blog.orchid.com/exfdic-regulator-on-trust-and-the-battle-of-the-social-media-videos/" title="">believes that</a> the 2008 US bank run was sparked by youtube posts of queues forming at banks. He says those that formed the initial lines carried memories of the great depression, but that once youtube started showing the footage more broadly the contagion struck. In the world of instant messaging media today we can perhaps see how this might happen again. More recently, the 2023 ‘wobble’ in global banking caused by the collapse of America’s 5th largest <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-svb-and-signature-bank-failed-so-fast-and-the-us-banking-crisis-isnt-over-yet-201737" title="">bank SVB</a> has precipitated strong intervention by the federal government, who have opted to ‘backstop’ investor deposits. In the midst of this potential crisis it it notable that TikTok (now arguably the world’s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/popular-domains-year-in-review-2021/" title="">most popular search engine</a>) is carrying millions of hashtag references to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bankrun?lang=en" title="">bankruns</a>. Senator Kelly in the USA <a href="https://public.substack.com/p/exclusive-senator-mark-kelly-called" title="">allegedly inquired</a> about the potential for limiting such references on social media, and a UK minister is <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tiktok-ban-minister-asks-national-cyber-security-centre-to-look-into-safety-of-app-12833371" title="">asking for security services</a> to examine the risks of the Chinese application. The perhaps reflects concern about algorithmically driven geopolitically motivated threats to the banking system.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p10">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS7.p10.1">There is a growing awareness of the role of banks in the economy, and a growing desire for greater transparency and accountability. There is also a growing mistrust of banks, particularly in light of the Global Financial Crisis. As we have seen, the advent of new technologies, such as blockchain CBDC, and fintech, is changing the way that banks operate and interact with customers. This presents both opportunities and challenges for the banking industry. As a final controversial aside, there is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/signature-bank-fdic-barney-frank-silicon-valley-6ad86262d9945675a42d735b66ace4f2" title="">industry suspicion</a> that the collapse of SVB has been used as cover to close the final US bank servicing crypto, effectively decapitating the banking rails of the industry, and forcing it overseas. Were it not for the credibility of the people making these claims, this would seem pretty wild, but the prevailing winds are surely blowing against the disruptive potential of a money system which is beyond the control of legislators.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>9.1.8 </span>Surveillance Capitalism</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p1.1">Surveillance capitalism is a term coined by Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff to describe the business model of using data collected from individuals to target advertising and influence behavior. The concept of surveillance capitalism emerged in the late 20th and early 21st centuries with the rise of technology companies that specialize in gathering and analyzing personal data.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p2">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p2.1">The history of surveillance capitalism can be traced back to the early days of the internet. In the 1990s, companies such as DoubleClick and Omniture began collecting data on internet users’ browsing habits in order to target advertising. As the internet grew in popularity, these companies were able to gather an increasing amount of data on individuals, allowing them to more effectively target advertising and increase profits.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p3">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p3.1">The advent of smart phones and mobile technology in the 2000s further expanded the reach of surveillance capitalism. With the widespread adoption of smart phones and mobile apps, companies were able to collect even more data on individuals, including location data and information about their physical activity. This data was used to target advertising and influence behavior, leading to the rise of companies such as Google and Facebook, which have become dominant players in the digital advertising market.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p4">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p4.1">The use of data collected from individuals to influence behaviour has also been used to influence political campaigns. In the 2016 US presidential election, Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm, used data collected from Facebook users to influence voter behaviour. The firm used the data to target advertising and create psychological profiles of individuals, allowing them to more effectively influence voter behaviour.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p5">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p5.1">The business model of surveillance capitalism has been widely criticized for its ethical implications. Critics argue that the collection and use of personal data without consent is a violation of individuals’ privacy and that the use of data to influence behaviour is manipulative and unethical. In recent years, there have been calls for greater regulation of the tech industry to address these concerns.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p6">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p6.1">Surveillance capitalism has led to significant compliance overheads for companies that collect and use personal data. There are a number of laws and regulations that have been put in place to protect individuals’ privacy, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in California, USA. These laws require companies to obtain consent from individuals before collecting and using their data, and to provide individuals with the right to access, correct, and delete their data.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p7">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p7.1">Complying with these laws can be costly and time-consuming for companies. They may need to hire additional staff to handle data privacy compliance, and may also need to invest in new technology to manage and protect personal data. In addition, companies are at risk of significant fines if they fail to comply with these laws.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p8">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p8.1">In terms of who profits from surveillance capitalism, the primary beneficiaries are technology companies such as Google and Facebook, which have become dominant players in the digital advertising market. These companies collect and analyse large amounts of personal data, which they use to target advertising and influence behavior. This allows them to generate significant profits from advertising revenue.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p9">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p9.1">On the other hand, those who suffer the most negative impact from surveillance capitalism are individuals, whose personal data is collected and used without their consent. They are also at risk of their privacy being violated, and their personal data being misused. Additionally, the collection and use of personal data can lead to the manipulation of individuals’ behaviour and decision-making, which can have negative consequences for their lives and society at large.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p10">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p10.1">Moreover, the business model of surveillance capitalism has also been criticized for creating a power imbalance between companies and individuals. Companies have access to vast amounts of personal data, which they can use to influence behavior and make decisions that affect individuals’ lives. This can lead to a lack of privacy and autonomy for individuals, and can also lead to discrimination and bias in decision-making.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p11">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p11.1">This is collectively an erosion of the demarcation between data, state surveillance, banking, and political leadership globally.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p12">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p12.1">The term "surveillance state" refers to a state in which government agencies have the power to collect and analyze large amounts of personal data, often without the consent of individuals. The rise of surveillance capitalism has led to concerns about the potential for the creation of a surveillance state, as government agencies may use the data collected by companies for surveillance purposes.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p13">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p13.1">There have been instances where government agencies have used data collected by companies for surveillance purposes. For example, in the United States, the National Security Agency (NSA) has been accused of using data collected by companies such as Google and Facebook for surveillance purposes. The agency’s PRISM program, which was revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013, was designed to collect and analyze data from internet companies in order to identify and track individuals. Europe is <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/" title="">clear about it’s intentions</a> to mandate their complete access to all encrypted personal communications in forthcoming legislation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p14">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p14.1">The use of data collected by companies for surveillance purposes can have significant implications for individuals’ privacy and civil liberties. It can also lead to a lack of transparency and accountability, as government agencies may use the data without the knowledge or consent of individuals. In addition, the use of data for surveillance purposes can lead to discrimination and bias in decision-making, as well as a chilling effect on free speech and the exercise of other rights.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p15">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p15.1">Akten has been <a href="https://memoakten.medium.com/all-watched-over-by-machines-of-loving-grace-8c2464aa6fda" title="">talking about</a> the phase transition from digital surveillance to pernicious corporate AI in terms of a modern ‘religion’ for many years <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx142" title="">142</a>]</cite>. He feels that despite public awareness of privacy invasion, there has been no significant outcry or unanimous demand for privacy. Instead, most individuals seem to find comfort in the belief that a higher force is watching and protecting the virtuous, while punishing wrongdoers. The concept of a ‘digital deity’ emerge from his thinking in this context, reflecting the role that religion and traditional gods have played in providing ethical frameworks, security, discipline, power, and other societal functions. More recently O’Gieblyn has been drawing the same conclusions <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx143" title="">143</a>]</cite>, explicitly linking religiosity to the imperative to ‘create a godhead’ simply because it can be done, not pausing to discuss if it should be. Rosenberg calls this ‘a threat to Epistemic Agency’ <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx144" title="">144</a>]</cite>More recently the Harari, author of Sapiens <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx145" title="">145</a>]</cite> <a href="https://forumlive.frontiersin.org/agenda/speakers/2977577" title="">said of AI</a>: <span id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p15.1.1">“For thousands of years, prophets and poets and politicians have used language and storytelling in order to manipulate and to control people and to reshape society. Now AI is likely to be able to do it. And once it can… it doesn’t need to send killer robots to shoot us. It can get humans to pull the trigger. We need to act quickly before AI gets out of our control. Drug companies cannot sell people new medicines without first subjecting these products to rigorous safety checks.”</span> (AI will be discussed in detail in a later chapter).</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p16">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p16.1">Klein at the New York Times has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/opinion/chatbots-artificial-intelligence-future-weirdness.html" title="">writing against this point</a> for some time. His well articulated fear, is that the current model where three major Western companies, with similar highly competitive capitalist origins and values, should certainly not be in charge of racing to monetise the most compelling and innately unknowable chat bot experience. As societies shift towards materialism and technological dependence, traditional gods lose their relevance, and the need for a new form of overseer arises. This digital deity, existing within the realm of technology and the cloud, perhaps represents an adaptation of primal human belief systems. This will be explored further in the AI/ML chapter later.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p17">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p17.1">In conclusion, the rise of surveillance capitalism has led to concerns about the potential for the creation of a surveillance state, or worse, a new kind of omnipresent digital culturla authority. Corporations and government agencies may use the data collected by companies for surveillance purposes. This can have significant implications for individuals’ privacy and civil liberties. It’s important for laws and regulations to be in place to safeguard citizens’ rights and privacy in regards to the use of data by government agencies, and to hold them accountable for any misuse of data, and yet it seems the reality of the situation in ‘post Snowden’ seems far from that.</p></div>

<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p19.1">Much of the following text is paraphrased from the work of Guy Turner of ‘The Coin Bureau’, and Lawyer and academic Eden Moglen, and needs more work because of it’s critical importance to the book.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p20">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p20.1">The adoption of printing by Europeans in the 15th century led to concerns around access to printed material. The right to read and the right to publish were central subjects in the struggle for freedom of thought for most of the last half millennium. The basic concern was for the right to read in private and to think, speak, and act based on a free and uncensored will. The primary antagonist for freedom of thought at the beginning of this struggle was the universal Catholic Church, an institution aimed at controlling thought in the European world through weekly surveillance of individuals, censorship of all reading material, and the ability to predict and punish unorthodox thought. In early modern Europe, the tools available for thought control were limited, but they were effective. For hundreds of years, the struggle centered around the book as a mass-manufactured article in Western culture, and whether individuals could print, possess, traffic, read, or teach from books without the permission or control of an entity empowered to punish thought. By the end of the 17th century, censorship of written material in Europe began to break down in waves throughout the European world, and the book became an article of subversive commerce, undermining the control of thought.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p21">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p21.1">Currently, a new phase in human history is beginning as we are building a single extraneous digital nervous system, that will connect every human mind. Within two generations, every single human being will be connected to this network, in which all thoughts, plans, dreams, and actions will flow as nervous impulses. The fate of freedom of thought and human freedom as a whole will depend upon the organization of this network. Our current generation is the last in which human brains will be formed without contact with this network, and from now on, every human brain will be formed from early life in direct connection to the network, with input from generative AI/ML systems. This possibly results in humanity becoming a super organism of a sort, where each of us is but a neuron in the brain. Unfortunately, this generation has been raised to be consumers of media, which is now consuming us.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p22">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p22.1">Anonymous reading is being determined against. Efforts discussed throughout the book to ensure privacy, from Zimmerman and the cypherpunks onward, have been met with resistance from government efforts to monitor and control information flow. The outcome of the organization of this network, and the freedom it allows, is currently being decided by this generation.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p23">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p23.1">It is not solely the ease of surveillance, nor solely the permanence of data, that is concerning, it is the relentless nature of living after the “end of forgetting”. Today’s encrypted traffic, which is used with relative security, will eventually be decrypted as more data becomes available for crypto analysis. This means that security protocols will need to be constantly updated and redone. Furthermore, no information is ever truly lost, and every piece of information can be retained and eventually linked to other information. This is the rationale behind government officials who argue that a robust social graph of the United States is needed. The primary form of data collection that should be of most concern is media that is used to spy on us, such as books that watch us read them and search boxes that report our searches to unknown parties. There is a lot of discussion about data coming out of Meta/Facebook, but the true threat is code going in. For the past 15 years, enterprise computing has been adding a layer of analytics on top of data warehouses, which is known as business intelligence. This allows for the vast amount of data in a company’s possession to be analyzed and used to answer questions the company did not know it had. The real threat of Facebook is the business intelligence layer on top of the Facebook data warehouse, which contains the behaviour of nearly a billion people. Intelligence agencies from around the world want to access this layer in order to find specific classes of people, such as potential agents, sources, and individuals that can be influenced or tortured. The goal is to run code within Facebook to extract this information, instead of obtaining data from Facebook, which would be dead data once extracted. Facebook wants to be a media company and control the web, but the reality is the true value of Facebook is the information and behavior of it’s users, and the ability to mine that data.
Distributed internet protocols are important in the context of government overreach into digital society and people’s private lives because they provide a level of decentralization and resilience that can help protect against censorship and surveillance.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p24">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p24.1">For example, if a government were to attempt to censor or block access to a centralized internet service, it could potentially do so with relative ease. However, if that same service were distributed across a network of nodes, it would be much more difficult for the government to effectively censor or block access to it.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p25">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p25.1">Another advantage of distributed protocols is that they are typically more resilient to attacks or failures. If one node in the network goes offline or is compromised, the others can continue to operate, ensuring that the service remains available. This can be especially important in situations where the internet is being used for critical communication, such as during a natural disaster or political crisis.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p26">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p26.1">In addition to their benefits for censorship resistance and resilience, distributed protocols can also help protect people’s privacy. Because they do not rely on centralized servers or infrastructure, they can be more difficult for governments or other entities to monitor or track. This can be especially important in countries where government surveillance is prevalent or where individuals may be at risk of persecution for their online activities.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p27">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p27.1">There are a number of distributed protocols that have been developed specifically to address issues of censorship and privacy, and these will be covered in more detail later.</p></div>

<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p28.1">It is important to note that distributed protocols are not a silver bullet for censorship or privacy concerns. They can be vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as those that target the nodes of the network, and they may not always be practical for certain types of applications. However, they do provide an important tool for those seeking to protect their freedom of expression and privacy online. They offer a valuable tool for those seeking to protect their freedom of expression and privacy online, and they will likely continue to play a critical role in the future of the internet.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p29">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p29.1">In recent years, several countries have proposed or passed bills that would result in unprecedented levels of online censorship. One such example is Canada’s Bill C-11, also known as the Online Streaming Act. This bill was first proposed in November 2020 as Bill C-10, but failed to pass due to its controversial provisions. It was reintroduced in February 2021 as Bill C-11 and was approved by the Canadian House of Commons, the first step in the process of becoming law. If passed, the bill would give the Canadian Radio, Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) the power to decide what content Canadians can view on YouTube and other social media platforms. The CRTC would also have the power to dictate what content creators can produce, with a focus on promoting "Canadian content." Additionally, the bill would require certain broadcasters to contribute to the Canada Media Fund, which is used to fund mainstream media in Canada. The bill is currently being considered by the Canadian Senate, which will vote on it in February. If passed, it will then be debated by the Canadian Parliament. Tech companies such as YouTube have reportedly failed to convince the Senate to exclude user-generated content from the bill, indicating a high likelihood of it becoming law. The potential impact on the internet and free expression in Canada is significant, as the bill would give the government significant control over online content and restrict the ability of individuals to share their views and perspectives.</p></div>

<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p31.1">The European Union (EU) has separated its online censorship efforts into two separate bills: the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act. These bills were introduced in December 2020 and are part of the EU’s Digital Services package, which aims to be completed by 2030. The Digital Services package is the second phase of the EU’s digital agenda, which is being enforced through regulation in the public sector and through ESG investing in the private sector. Both the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act were passed in spring 2022 and went into force in autumn 2022, but will not be enforced until later this year and early next year, depending on the size of the relevant entity. The Digital Markets Act aims to increase the EU’s competitiveness in the tech space by imposing massive fines on "gatekeepers," or companies that maintain monopolies by giving preference to their own products and services. This could open the door to innovation in cryptocurrency in the EU, but also requires gatekeepers to provide detailed data about the individuals and institutions using their products and services to the EU. The Digital Services Act, on the other hand, aims to regulate the content that is available online, including user-generated content. It does this by requiring companies to remove illegal content within one hour of it being reported and by imposing fines for non-compliance. The act also requires companies to implement measures to protect users from illegal content and from "other forms of harm," which is defined broadly and could include a wide range of content. The EU is also in the process of passing the Artificial Intelligence Regulation Act, which will be discussed later this year and is reportedly the first of its kind. All five bills in the EU’s Digital Services package are regulations, meaning they will override the national laws of EU countries. The potential impact on the internet and free expression in the EU is significant, as the Digital Services Act would give the government significant control over online content and restrict the ability of individuals to share their views and perspectives.</p></div>

<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p32.1">In the United States, two significant documents related to online censorship are the Kids Online Safety Act and the Supreme Court case Gonzalez v. Google. The Kids Online Safety Act was introduced in February 2021 and is expected to pass later this year due to bipartisan support. The act requires online services to collect Know Your Customer (KYC) information to ensure that they are not showing harmful content to minors. It also gives the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the power to decide when children have been made unsafe online and allows parents to sue tech companies if their children have been harmed online. The act has received criticism from both sides of the political spectrum and entities outside of Congress, as it is seen as giving too much power to the government to regulate online content and could lead to increased censorship by tech companies.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p33">
<p id="Ch9.S1.SS8.p33.1">The Supreme Court case Gonzalez v. Google involves the question of whether Google’s algorithmic recommendations supported terrorism and contributed to the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. The case has been picked up by the Supreme Court after being passed up by various courts of appeal. It is being heard alongside another case, Twitter v. Tumne, involving the role of Twitter’s algorithms in a terrorist attack in Istanbul. There are two potential outcomes for the case. If the Supreme Court sides with Gonzalez, it could increase the liability of social media companies under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which allows them to moderate content to a limited extent without violating the First Amendment. Alternatively, the Supreme Court could declare Section 230 unconstitutional, which would make online censorship illegal but also hinder the use of algorithms on the internet. The ideal outcome, in theory, would be for the Supreme Court to side with Google and for Congress to change Section 230. However, giving Congress the power to change the law could lead to increased censorship and the potential for abuse of power.</p></div>

<span>9.2 </span>Government over-reach through bureaucracy</h4>
<div id="Ch9.S2.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S2.p1.1">As an contextual example of the soft power which political apparatus uses to influence emergent human behaviour and their markets it is useful to look again to the USA. In 2013, the Obama Administration, faced with a divided Congress, resorted to using the banking system as a means to implement policy through non-traditional channels. This effort, known as Operation Choke Point, was a continuation of their success in cutting off the offshore online poker industry from banking services. Initially, the crackdown was aimed at the payday lending industry, but it soon expanded to include gun sales and adult entertainment, and eventually up to 30 different industries.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S2.p2">
<p id="Ch9.S2.p2.1">The rationale behind Operation Choke Point was to target banks that facilitated fraud, as indicated by a high ratio of fraud and disputes. However, the operation soon evolved into a redlining of industries based on nothing more than the perceived risk of reputational harm. Financial institutions were investigated without any evidence of losses. Throughout the entire operation, there was no new legislation or written guidance issued. Banks were simply warned of increased regulatory scrutiny if they did not comply.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S2.p3">
<p id="Ch9.S2.p3.1">Major banks continue to deny services to industries such as firearms and fossil fuels, and they continue to assign higher risk ratings to industries that may face government criticism, even in the absence of any official guidance. This utilisation of the financial system as a means of driving change is seen by some as a legitimate, if not ideal, mechanism; as just one more type of market actor. Regardless of one’s political perspective, it is important to consider the moral hazard of bypassing traditional political channels and using bureaucratic mechanisms as a means of affecting change in the free market. It is important to consider how the power of these tactics might be used in the future by opposing political groups. For example, supporters of Operation Choke Point who were in favour of increased financial pressure on the oil and gas industry may not feel the same if the same techniques were applied to organizations like Planned Parenthood. From this perspective, the tactics used by Operation Choke Point can be seen as undemocratic, regardless of who is deploying them. Bringing this back to our study of new financial tooling in crypto we can look to recent events:</p></div>

<p id="Ch9.S2.p4.1">It seems that in the absence of democratic the SEC is attempting to use their tools to control and centralise the ‘ramps’ into and out of digital assets, and the rules around holding them for investors. The SEC has proposed a new rule that would require registered investment advisors to use qualified custodians for all assets, including cryptocurrencies. The intention behind this proposal is to improve investor protection by mandating that custodians hold customer assets in segregated and identifiable accounts. However, critics argue that this proposal would limit the number of qualified cryptocustodians and deter investment advisors from advising their clients on crypto. The few banks with the necessary technical capabilities and regulatory approvals will have a monopoly on crypto custodial services, while exchanges without a banking license or trust bank will likely lose out. The proposal assumes that crypto assets are securities without going through a process to determine that. The outcome of the proposal will depend on the stringency of the SEC’s qualified custodian registrations. The proposal is currently in a 60-day public comment period before the Commissioners hold another vote on whether to pass the rule.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S2.p5">
<p id="Ch9.S2.p5.1">Caitlyn Long explains that the proposed rule would not necessarily kill crypto custody, but would be a move against State Charter trust companies. She points out the big issue with the proposal, which is the requirement for custodians to indemnify for negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct. This would apply to all asset classes, including commodities and crypto, which could kill the custody business broadly. The SEC proposal would apply the custody rule to all asset classes, including commodities and crypto, which is okay, but the SEC also wants custodians to indemnify the full asset value for losses in which the custodian played any role, even for physical assets like oil, cattle, and wheat. This would upset long-standing insurance terms and could cause huge pushback from the banking, Wall Street, commodities, and crypto industries. Sarah Brennan believes that the proposal represents continued governmental efforts at denial of service attacks on crypto, and that the SEC’s approach only seeks to chill digital asset markets. She and the Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee are urging stakeholders to submit public comments on the proposed amendments to ensure the custody rule for investment advisors is modernized appropriately. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service plans to hire nearly 30k new staff and technology over the next two years, spending $80 billion to improve tax enforcement, much of it focussing on crypto markets. It might be that the industry follows the prevailing winds <a href="https://noelleacheson.substack.com/p/weekly-feb-25-2023" title="">and pivots to the East</a>.

<h4>
<span>9.3 </span>Global monetary policy</h4>
<div id="Ch9.S3.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S3.p1.1">The term “don’t fight the Fed” has been used in trading circles for many years. Owing to the pre-eminent role of the dollar in global markets actions of the political and central banking bodies which impact the dollar always have global reach. It is worth knowing that these decisions are usually contested, and worse, the power of the decision makers seems rooted in their narrative impact. It’s a pretty terrible system given the impact on billions of lives. The Federal Reserve System, which is comprised of a Board of Governors, 12 regional banks, and an Open Market Committee, is a privately-owned central banking system in the United States. The member banks of each Federal Reserve Bank vote on the majority of the Reserve Bank’s directors and the directors vote on members to serve on the Open Market Committee, which determines monetary policy. The president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank is traditionally given the vice chairmanship of the Open Market Committee and is a permanent committee member. This means that private banks are the key determinants in the composition of the Open Market Committee, which regulates the entire economy. The Federal Reserve is an independent agency and its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government. The Fed’s profits are returned to the Treasury each year, but the member banks’ shares of the Fed earn them a 6% dividend. The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bailouts exposed the fundamental conflicts of interest at the heart of the Federal Reserve System, where the very banks that caused the crisis were the recipients of the trillions of dollars in bailout money. These conflicts of interest were baked into the Federal Reserve Act over 100 years ago and are a structural feature of the institution. The concentration of power within this group is staggering.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>9.4.1 </span>Gridless</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S4.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S4.SS1.p1.1">In the course of researching this book we see most opportunity for change in Africa. As an example the company ‘Gridless’ began by examining different energy sources in Africa and exploring opportunities for larger energy generation and grid-connected energy. However, they found that the real benefit of gridless energy was in providing energy to places that were not well connected and did not have a good grid. They contacted mini-grid providers all over East and Southern Africa to learn about their problems. A mini-grid is defined as a project that generates energy under 2 megawatts, often under 1 megawatt. They discovered that these providers had to overbuild for the community, resulting in stranded energy. The company found a way to utilize this stranded energy by placing Bitcoin miners on it and paying the mini-grid providers for it. They tested this method and found it to be successful. Additionally, they implemented a system to automate and remotely turn off the power during periods of high usage to make the grid more efficient and sustainable. This solution provided a win-win-win situation for the company, the mini-grid providers, and the communities they served.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S4.SS1.p2">
<p id="Ch9.S4.SS1.p2.1">The company utilizes Bitcoin miners to create space for other activities and to increase access to affordable energy for communities and small businesses. As energy usage increases in the community, the company decreases their usage of miners and moves them to other locations. This is outlined in their contracts with partners. The company is currently testing this method and has encountered some challenges, such as losing internet connection at one of their sites and poor rainfall affecting the amount of water flowing into turbines. They have found that building a lean operation with flexible and adaptable staff is crucial, as well as creating processes and systems to manage variables. The company also faces unique environmental factors such as lightning strikes, which require them to turn off their operations temporarily.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S4.SS1.p3">
<p id="Ch9.S4.SS1.p3.1">Gridless suggest that those who are critical of opportunities like this often come from a place of privilege and do not understand the consequences of their actions in places like Africa where access to electricity and other resources is limited. They argue that these critics, who are often from the West, have blinders on and cannot see the impact of their actions on a global scale. They suggest that more people need to travel and have diverse experiences in order to change their perspective on Bitcoin and its potential to support human flourishing in underprivileged areas. They also mention that gridless plans may become a case study for the positive impact of Bitcoin mining on economic opportunities, particularly in rural Africa.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>9.5 </span>El Salvador as a case study</h4>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p1.1">El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin was a historic moment in the world of Bitcoin and was met with a mix of excitement and scepticism. On June 9, 2021, the country’s Legislative Assembly approved a bill introduced by President Nayib Bukele to make Bitcoin a legal tender alongside the US dollar, which has been used as the country’s official currency since 2001.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p2">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p2.1">President Bukele, who has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, stated that the adoption of Bitcoin was a way to promote financial inclusion and stability in the country, where more than 70% of the population is unbanked or underbanked. In a tweet, he stated, “Bitcoin will have the same value as the US dollar. We will support both. They will have the same power of purchase and will be accepted in the same way.”</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p3">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p3.1">The move was met with a lot of media attention and reaction, with some praising it as a bold and innovative step, while others raised concerns about the volatility of Bitcoin and their potential impact on the economy. President Nayib Bukele himself has faced criticism for his handling of political power and some of his actions have raised concerns about the potential for abuses of power. In 2021, President Bukele faced widespread criticism for his handling of the legislative process and his use of the military to secure the Legislative Assembly building during a political standoff with lawmakers. This led to allegations of intimidation and a violation of democratic norms, and raised concerns about his willingness to use force to achieve his political goals. Additionally, President Bukele has faced criticism for his use of social media to communicate with the public and his tendency to bypass traditional media outlets, which has raised concerns about the potential for censorship and the manipulation of information. With that said he seems much loved in the country, and the previously appalling safety statistics of the nation have radically improved.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p4">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p4.1">In addition to the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador has also proposed the issuance of a Bitcoin-backed bond to finance various public works projects and promote the use of Bitcoin. The bond would be denominated in Bitcoin and would allow investors to directly participate in the country’s development while also supporting the growth and adoption of Bitcoin.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p5">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p5.1">Another ambitious project that has been proposed by President Bukele and his administration is the creation of “Bitcoin City”, a new city that would mine Bitcoin at the base of a dormant Volcano, and offer considerable tax benefits to holders. The city would serve as a hub for innovation and a showcase for the potential of Bitcoin, and would offer a wide range of services, including housing, healthcare, education, and entertainment.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p6">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p6.1">There has been a significant increase in the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador, and apparently increased inward investment to the country. Many businesses, both small and large, have started accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, and there has been a growing interest in Bitcoin among the general population. Additionally, the government has been actively promoting the use of Bitcoin through various initiatives. There have also been efforts to educate the public about Bitcoin and its potential benefits, including increased financial security and reduced transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p7">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p7.1">Overall, the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador has been positive, far outstripping the number of people in the country with traditional bank accounts, and has the potential to greatly impact the country’s economy and financial sector. However, it is important to note that there are still challenges to overcome, such as regulatory and infrastructure limitations, as well as ongoing concerns about the volatility and stability of Bitcoin.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p8">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p8.1">Somewhat surprisingly the IMF have de-escalated their previously highly critical assessment of the move, toward a more <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/10/el-salvador-staff-concluding-statement-of-the-2023-article-iv-mission" title="">concerned and conciliatory tone</a>:
<span id="Ch9.S5.p8.1.1">“Bitcoin’s risks should be addressed. While risks have not materialized due to the limited Bitcoin use so far—as suggested by survey and remittances data—its use could grow given its legal tender status and new legislative reforms to encourage the use of crypto assets, including tokenized bonds (Digital Assets Law). In this context, underlying risks to financial integrity and stability, fiscal sustainability, and consumer protection persist, and the recommendations of the 2021 Article IV remain valid. Greater transparency over the government’s transactions in Bitcoin and the financial situation of the state-owned Bitcoin-wallet (Chivo) remains essential, especially to assess the underlying fiscal contingencies and counterparty risks.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p9">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p9.1">In terms of economic impact, it is still too early to determine the full effects of the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador. However, it is expected to have a positive impact on financial inclusion and stability, as well as reducing the reliance on traditional banking systems. The use of Bitcoin has the potential to lower transaction fees and increase financial security, which could be particularly beneficial for those who do not have access to traditional banking services.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p10">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p10.1">Overall, the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador marks a significant step forward in the mainstream acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin and has the potential to set a precedent for other countries to follow. However, it is important to monitor the situation and assess the long-term impacts on the economy and financial sector.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p11">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p11.1">The swift rise of digital walled gardens, moving towards a less transparent internet, reveals both a need for user data protection and a corporate push for greater control and profit. Tech giants like Google, Reddit, and Twitter are increasingly controlling their platforms, adjusting data flows for revenue growth. Google’s new privacy policy, which allows data collection for AI model training, increases public concerns over user consent and privacy rights. The wide-ranging language of the policy gives Google considerable power in using user-generated content, fueling debates on data usage ethics. Simultaneously, the social web’s shift towards an entertainment-focused business model prioritizes revenue over human connection. Platforms target ad revenue through vertically scrolling videos, risking reduced content diversity and creating echo chambers.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p12">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p12.1">Entertainment unions like the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) are grappling with AI’s impact on employment. Their approach includes research, collaboration, education, political advocacy, organizing, and collective bargaining to protect members’ interests, including upskilling initiatives. Upskilling is gaining industry attention. Companies like Tata Consultancy highlight the need to equip engineers with AI skills. Recognizing AI technologies’ potential, they invest in reskilling programs to stay competitive and effectively use AI tools.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p13">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p13.1">The rise of generative AI and the declining open web raises concerns about maintaining digital commons and encouraging diverse perspectives. AI-generated content could overshadow human contributions, making meaningful information harder to find and increasing misinformation risks. This situation highlights the need for balance between AI-generated and human-generated content.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p14">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p14.1">Data control battles between platforms and users fuel debates on data ownership and profit sharing. Users demand more control over their data use and potentially a share in the resulting profits. This issue emphasizes the need for transparent data policies and fair user compensation models.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p15">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p15.1">The influence of AI on the job market and the future of work is a significant concern. As AI technology progresses, the need for upskilling and reskilling programs grows to ensure workers can adapt to changing job requirements. Collaboration between industries, governments, and educational institutions is essential to address AI-induced disruptions and ensure a smooth workforce transition.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S5.p16">
<p id="Ch9.S5.p16.1">Finally, the importance of AI ethics and governance grows as AI technologies become more prevalent. The development and deployment of AI systems require ethical frameworks, transparency, and accountability. Collaboration between AI researchers, policymakers, and ethicists is critical to address potential risks and societal implications of AI technology.</p></div>

<div id="Ch9.S6.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS1.p1.1">The examination of AI’s implications on societal structures should undoubtedly receive the necessary attention. Soros’s language and perception of reality seem particularly interesting, especially in the era of AI. He emphasizes his belief in reality and its importance in providing moral guidance, a concept that seems increasingly challenged in the age of AI.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>9.6.2 </span>AI, Propaganda, and Authoritarianism</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS2.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS2.p1.1">In an opinion piece for The Hill by Bill Drexel and Caleb Withers, titled "Generative AI could be an authoritarian breakthrough in brainwashing," the authors argue that the concern isn’t just external attempts to influence U.S. elections, but the impact on the populations within authoritarian countries. They posit that foreign disinformation efforts by Chinese and Russian entities are only the tip of the iceberg, with Beijing and Moscow disseminating massive amounts of propaganda to their own populations. The authors also cite instances of AI-enabled propaganda and misinformation campaigns, both in the context of undermining democracies and consolidating control within authoritarian states.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>9.6.3 </span>Increased Surveillance Through AI</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS3.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS3.p1.1">Another critical concern around AI and authoritarianism is the potential for increased surveillance. With the integration of AI and data scraping techniques, governments can employ extensive teams to facilitate unprecedented levels of surveillance, compromising privacy. Such concerns are raised in the works of authors like Daniel Oberhaus, who posits that authoritarian regimes may have an advantage in AI due to their willingness to exploit data, such as advanced facial recognition data, in ways that open societies might not.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>9.6.5 </span>AI and Ideology</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS5.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS5.p1.1">One way AI might foster authoritarianism is by supporting the ideology of closed societies or authoritarian regimes, such as China. These societies may leverage their global influence to disseminate their particular AI model, aligning it with their motivations and goals. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace points out that for most countries, AI technology is viewed as an economic development factor that determines their standing in the global technology race, rather than as an ideological preference.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>9.6.6 </span>AI and Central Planning</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS6.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS6.p1.1">Another concern is the fear that AI will make centrally planned economies seem viable, where past attempts failed due to the lack of data. This idea was discussed in a conversation between Peter Thiel and Reed Hoffman hosted by Neil Ferguson at Stanford in 2018. Thiel posited that AI appears to favor centralization, an aspect that supports the principles of central planning.</p></div>

<div id="Ch9.S6.SS7.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS7.p1.1">On the other hand, some suggest that capitalist competition could result in the creation of AGI that cannot be controlled. Dr. Jeffrey Hinton, a vocal advocate of this view, argues that AI’s potential to disrupt business models could drive companies to recklessly pursue advancements in AI to stay competitive. This could lead to increased state power as people become more reliant on the state in an AI-dominated economy, potentially resulting in increased authoritarianism.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>9.6.10 </span>AI’s Impact on Societal Organization</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS10.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS10.p1.1">Given these diverse viewpoints, it seems that the potential of AI to either aid authoritarianism or promote freedom is yet to be fully explored. However, the inherent ability of democracies to encourage disagreement and diverse perspectives may serve as a counterbalance to the potential of AI for authoritarian control. Moreover, AI’s capacity as a catalytic force in societal organization should not be underestimated. The increasing discourse around AI and its implications for labor and technology usage suggests that AI technology is reshaping the world in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago. Its capabilities in data analysis, decision making, and automation are transforming industries and redefining the scope of what’s possible.</p></div>

<div id="Ch9.S6.SS11.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS11.p1.1">An argument often made in favor of democratization of AI technology is that it should be made open-source and freely available, thus creating a challenging framework for global political incumbents. This perspective is grounded on the belief that technology - and its underlying power - must be accessible to everyone to mitigate the risks of misuse and ensure fair benefits distribution.</p></div>

<div id="Ch9.S6.SS13.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS13.p1.1">However, as beneficial as open-source AI may appear, the complexity of global politics can make the transition challenging. A landscape where AI technologies are open-source and freely available brings about potential dilemmas in various areas including national security, economic competitiveness, intellectual property rights, and data privacy.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch9.S6.SS14">
<h5>
<span>9.6.14 </span>National Security and Open-source AI</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS14.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS14.p1.1">To start, national security is a primary concern. AI has a myriad of applications in defense and security sectors, many of which could potentially be exploited by adversarial entities. As such, unrestricted access to AI technologies could pose a risk to nations’ security. Nevertheless, it is crucial to note that security risks also stem from concentrated AI power. A handful of nations or corporations owning the majority of AI developments may lead to destabilization, power imbalance, and heightened global tensions.</p></div>

<section id="Ch9.S6.SS15">
<h5>
<span>9.6.15 </span>Economic Competitiveness and Open-source AI</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS15.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS15.p1.1">Economic competitiveness is another intricate aspect. Countries and corporations are engaged in a fiercely competitive race to advance in AI technologies, recognizing the economic gains and strategic advantages tied to AI leadership. Open-source AI might challenge this dynamic, disrupting traditional models of competition. However, it could also create an environment of shared growth, leading to a more balanced global AI landscape.</p></div>

<section id="Ch9.S6.SS16">
<h5>
<span>9.6.16 </span>Intellectual Property Rights and Open-source AI</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS16.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS16.p1.1">Intellectual property rights form another complex dimension in the discussion. Open-source AI challenges traditional notions of ownership and patents, potentially undermining the incentives for companies and individuals to invest in AI research and development. Balancing the need for innovation with the necessity to protect inventors’ rights becomes critical in an open-source framework.</p></div>

<h5>
<span>9.6.19 </span>Conclusion</h5>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS19.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS19.p1.1">In conclusion, making AI open-source and freely available represents a shift from the status quo, with both promising potentials and daunting challenges. A global AI framework that upholds democratic principles and values, promotes shared prosperity, and safeguards security and privacy is the aspiration. To achieve this, an inclusive and multidimensional discourse is essential, involving governments, corporations, civil society, academia, and individual citizens. It is through this collective effort that AI’s true potential can be harnessed for the global good.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS19.p2">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS19.p2.1">There is skepticism the idea of artificial general intelligence (AGI) leading to superintelligent machines that threaten humanity in the near future. This supposed risk of AGI is described as a "red herring" - an unfounded fear. The reasons given are:</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS19.p3">
<ul id="Ch9.S6.I1">
<li id="Ch9.S6.I1.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch9.S6.I1.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.I1.i1.p1.1">We do not have a clear understanding or definition of general intelligence or consciousness.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch9.S6.I1.i2">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch9.S6.I1.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.I1.i2.p1.1">Current AI like large language models are limited in scope. They are good at statistical pattern matching in language, not generally intelligent.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch9.S6.I1.i3">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch9.S6.I1.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch9.S6.I1.i3.p1.1">The hypothesis that intelligence and consciousness emerge simply from increasing computational power is unproven. There are likely other components we don’t understand.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS19.p4">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS19.p4.1">The real risk is perhaps government control and regulation of AI development and applications, justified by arguing it is needed for safety and responsible AI. This could impose limits on acceptable speech and thought. Centralised entities could become gatekeepers for how people access and interpret information about the world. Mandating allowable language could narrow ideas and speech to fit an official narrative. Fears of AGI, even if exaggerated, open the door for regulators and bureaucrats to intervene in the name of safety. The risk is not AGI itself but the government control that hype about it enables.</p></div>
<div id="Ch9.S6.SS19.p5">
<p id="Ch9.S6.SS19.p5.1">There is speculation that AI will automate many white collar cognitive jobs, similar to how industrial machinery automated manual labor. This may "chase humans up the value stack" as lower value work is handled by AI, freeing people to focus on higher value creative activities.</p></div>

<div id="Ch10.S3.SS1.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S3.SS1.p1.1">Distributed financial tooling and digital assets, have ignited imagination and adoption within and outside of the Metaverse context. A global ledger could unite isolated digital ecosystems and enable the transfer of portable ‘goods’ across digital society. An open-source Metaverse should emphasize the development and adoption of open protocols and data formats. The Nostr protocol, for instance, might link and federate mixed reality spaces, providing identity assurances and mediating data synchronization while maintaining reasonably strong cryptography. This also allows integration with the legacy web through ubiquitous web sockets. Bitcoin and associated technologie, despite their issues, have the potential to revolutionize the way digital society operates by enabling “money-like networks” which are a cornerstone of human interaction. Representations of traditional currencies can ride securely on top of these networks as stablecoins, opening up global collaborative working practices, especially for emerging markets. Streaming micropayments and machine to machines (AI to AI) are crucially and under-considered in this context.</p></div>

<p id="Ch10.S3.SS3.SSSx1.p1.1">Autonomous AI agents, bonded to, but not bounded by, each federated mixed reality instance, can to be self-governing entities that operate within their federated virtual social spaces, drawing upon private Bitcoin and Lightning wallets to perform and mediate economic exchanges within the spaces. They could also trivially operate outside the virtual space, and within other spaces on the same metaverse federation. They would accomplish this by drawing on their ‘home’ GPU/TPU processors where appropriate, or else using distributed large language model (LLM) processing to accomplish tasks assigned by their instructors. They can interact with the ‘web2’ world using open-source software called auto-gpt and have constraints, such as “time to live” and limited access to funds through their Bitcoin Lightning wallets.</p><ul id="Ch10.S3.I1">

<p id="Ch10.S5.SS2.p1.1">Protecting user privacy and ensuring safeguarding is vital for any digital society platform. The open-source system must be developed in compliance with legislative and cultural norms while maintaining the balance between user privacy and the need for identity verification and data management. The evidence that social media is damaging youth mental health is very compelling <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx405" title="">405</a>]</cite>. The Centre for Humane Technology call social media the ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoVJKj8lcNQ" title="">first contact point</a> with AI’. They explains that new technologies often create an arms race. They list the negative impacts of this contact as including “information overload, addiction, doom scrolling, sexualization of kids, shortened attention spans, polarization, fake news, and breakdown of democracy”. These were not the intended consequence of engineers who aimed to maximize engagement.
The underlying arms race for attention led to what they call ‘an engagement monster’ that rewrote the rules of society.</p></div>

<p id="Ch10.S9.p1.1">Designing open federated metaverse from a 25 year research foundation
There are serious and under discussed natural social constraints on group behaviours, and these translate into social VR. For instance the ideal meeting size is 6, and this is naturally established in work settings. This has not translated into a metaverse setting where dozens of people routinely crash across one another. In the context of supporting a creative “backstage” world where set planning, production shots, etc can be discussed we believe we have solutions which will get the best out of distributed teams of film-makers.
Leveraging the world’s most powerful decentralised computing network to create
scale and security without high cost
The Bitcoin network is more than just a speculative money like asset, it is the most secure distributed computing system ever built. We can jump on the back of this at almost no cost to enable scale for transfer of value, trust, and digital assets of provenance.
Cryptographically assured end points
With the cryptography tools provided through integration of the Bitcoin network we can also use non-blockchain based secure messaging, and identity proofs.
Micro transactions in collaborative spaces
New tooling the space allows fractions of a pound or dollar to be exchanged between parties across the world. This means that work can be paid “by the second” both inside and outside of the metaverse. This radically improves creative microtask workflows.
World leading open source machine learning and bot architectures
By integrating Stablity AI tools for image generation, video processing, natural language, and speech to text / text to speech we hope to reduce friction within the backstage worlds.
Creating a narrative arrow from a remote director/producer/DP, through a VP screen into a shoot, and back into a persistent metaverse shared with the public
By linking across these new systems with world class telepresence research we hope to use a single digital context to support senior stakeholders, creatives, technical teams, and the wider public.
New paths to monetisation and digital ownership
This unified digital back end is optimised for flows of money, trust, and digital objects. This is a new area for VP.

<h6>VisionFlow: Ideate - Robotic Pre-Visualization</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1">VisionFlow: Ideate revolutionizes the pre-visualization process in the film industry. The system integrates open-source machine learning tools, robot control software, and AI to streamline and accelerate the creation of virtual 3D environments for new film scenes.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx1.p2.1">Instead of the conventional approach, VisionFlow: Ideate enables non-artists to lay out shots in a simple web or headset interface, much like a traditional storyboard. The generative AI then rapidly creates high-resolution backdrop plates with correct parallax cues, replacing conventional image and video plates.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx1.p3.1">The camera path synchronizes with a robot, and the backdrop plates are displayed on a 3D wall or in the studio mixdown from a green screen within minutes. The shot can be run repeatedly, allowing for adjustments in lighting and scene swapping for different ideas. This approach aligns well with pre-viz workflows, fostering rapid ideation, horizontal scaling through parallelized cloud vGPU, and expanded access to content creators since less software specialization is required.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx1.p4">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx1.p4.1">By inverting the conventional ICVFX workflow, VisionFlow: Ideate drives camera motion from the scene rather than scene motion from a tracked camera. It not only saves time and reduces costs but also lowers confusion, streamlining the Unreal creation pipeline, and generating additional revenue and process integration for robotics products.</p></div>

<h6>VisionFlow: Connect - Telepresence System</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx2.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx2.p1.1">VisionFlow: Connect is a breakthrough system in the film industry that brings remote directors to the heart of production using augmented reality technology. This is achieved through an innovative application of the Apple Vision Pro AR headset.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx2.p2">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx2.p2.1">In the VisionFlow: Connect system, the director, located remotely, wears an AR headset and navigates along a marked line. This line mirrors the inward-facing edge of a large-scale, wrap-around LED virtual production facility. Within the LED volume, participants can view the director’s avatar, providing a sense of spatial consistency and our work interaction, crucial for effective direction.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx2.p3">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx2.p3.1">A novel technique, "ghost frame" by Helios, is employed to prevent the camera within the LED volume from capturing the director’s remote avatar on the LED wall. This ensures the director’s virtual presence doesn’t interfere with the recorded footage.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx2.p4">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS0.SSSx2.p4.1">The benefits of VisionFlow: Connect are multifold. It allows senior stakeholders to manage their time more efficiently as they can direct remotely without needing to be physically present on multiple sets. Directors can interact in real-time, giving instantaneous feedback and adjustments. It also enhances directors’ spatial awareness of the scene, thereby improving the decision-making process.</p></div>

<p id="Ch10.S9.I2.i5.p1.1"><span id="Ch10.S9.I2.i5.p1.1.1">Data Extraction:</span> Visitors should have the ability to extract their distilled data or creations, enabling them to continue their vistor experience at home. This could also open up new possibilities for visitors to create and share their own narratives based on their visit experiences. To be clear this should not be the raw data supplied to the venue inferencing engines (which should be destroyed soon after use), but rather a distilled narrative of the inference from the system.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch10.S9.I2.i6">
<span>6.</span>
<div id="Ch10.S9.I2.i6.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.I2.i6.p1.1"><span id="Ch10.S9.I2.i6.p1.1.1">Data Privacy:</span> Data sharing should be underpinned by robust privacy controls to ensure guest data sovereignty.

<h6>Background</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx3.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx3.p1.1">Ubiquitous display technology, which allows different personalized views for multiple people on the same screen, has the potential to disrupt the way visitors interact and experience venues and exhibits. The displays can use techniques like lenticular lenses, or other steerable light, to send different light to viewers’ eyes, allowing for discrete, customized views.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx4">
<h6>Technical Overview</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx4.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx4.p1.1">The following display technologies have been identified as suitable for implementation:</p><ul id="Ch10.S9.I3">
<li id="Ch10.S9.I3.i1">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch10.S9.I3.i1.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.I3.i1.p1.1">Lenticular lens arrays: By placing an array of magnifying lenses over the screen, these displays direct light from alternating columns of pixels toward the left and right eyes to create a stereoscopic 3D image without glasses. There are several suppliers of this technology, mainly for the events market. It seems that churn of these companies is relatively high, with few demonstrating longevity.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch10.S9.I3.i2">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch10.S9.I3.i2.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.I3.i2.p1.1">Parallax barriers: These displays have a layer of opaque and transparent slits over the LCD matrix that directs different pixel columns to each eye, creating a stereoscopic 3D image without glasses. Alioscopy is known to use this approach, along with eye tracking technology. They have been in business for decades and are a good case study, but engaging with a research partner in China is likely the best medium terms approach.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch10.S9.I3.i3">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch10.S9.I3.i3.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.I3.i3.p1.1">These display consists of a large lenticular lens sheet or array of smaller tiled lenticular lenses mounted in front of a high-resolution LED. The lenticular lenses are cylindrical and arranged vertically, with each lens covering multiple pixel columns of the display.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch10.S9.I3.i4">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch10.S9.I3.i4.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.I3.i4.p1.1">Behind the lens array, the display content is formatted into vertical interleaved channels, with each channel containing a slightly different perspective view of the 3D stereoscopic image. The different perspective views are calculated in real-time based on the tracked head positions of multiple viewers in front of the display.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch10.S9.I3.i5">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch10.S9.I3.i5.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.I3.i5.p1.1">As light from the display pixels passes through the cylindrical lenses, it is refracted into multiple viewing zones in front of the screen. Each viewing zone contains a specific view channel, so each eye of each viewer sees the perspective that matches their position. This creates a glasses-free 3D effect with motion parallax as viewers move their heads.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch10.S9.I3.i6">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch10.S9.I3.i6.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.I3.i6.p1.1">The viewer head tracking system uses camera and computer vision techniques to determine the 3D positions of each viewer’s eyes in the space in front of the display. The changing viewer positions are fed to the display rendering system to compute the proper perspective views and adjust the lenticular flaps as needed.</p></div>
</li>
<li id="Ch10.S9.I3.i7">
<span>•</span>
<div id="Ch10.S9.I3.i7.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.I3.i7.p1.1">This lenticular 3D display with dynamic view steering provides illusion of depth for multiple viewers simultaneously, creating an immersive large-screen 3D experience without the need for special glasses. The real-time tracking and rendering system updates the content smoothly as the viewers move around, maintaining the stereo 3D perspectives tailored individually to each viewer’s changing position.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>
<section id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx5">
<h6>Tracking Technologies</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx5.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx5.p1.1">For personalization, tracking viewers’ eyes, face, gestures, etc., is necessary. This can be done with cameras and computer vision algorithms, employing techniques like mesh abstraction for body tracking, facial landmark recognition, gaze estimation, micro expression recognition, and gross gesture detection.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx6">
<h6>AI Integration</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx6.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx6.p1.1">AI can be integrated to steer personalized narratives and experiences subtly in the background or provide interactive moments. The AI backend can use game engines like Unreal Engine or Unity to render personalized content dynamically, allowing for real-time adaptation to the viewer’s reactions.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx7">
<h6>Privacy and Security</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx7.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx7.p1.1">The tracking data provides extremely valuable insights for personalizing experiences but raises significant privacy concerns. Thoughtful design around privacy and security, including data segmentation, auditing, and transparency, is critical to protect user data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx8">
<h6>Technical Challenges</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx8.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx8.p1.1">There are technical challenges in achieving dense personalized displays, especially for a large number of viewers. As of now, creating a personalized display for up to 5 people is feasible, but scaling up requires a substantial budget and careful planning. Fortunately both of these seem available and it seems timely to look at this option.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx9">
<h6>Proof of Concept</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx9.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx9.p1.1">Starting with a small-scale proof of concept for up to 5 people would allow for demonstration of the capabilities and building stakeholder confidence. This would also provide valuable insights into the technical and logistical challenges that may arise during larger-scale implementation.</p></div>
</section>
<section id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx10">
<h6>Future Developments</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx10.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx10.p1.1">The display technology is rapidly evolving, with new advancements in resolution, refresh rates, brightness, and tracking accuracy. As the technology matures, there will be more opportunities to enhance the personalized experiences.
This system would allow multiple viewers to see different images or perspectives from the same display, enhancing the interactive and educational value of the exhibit. Mollick et al. have done some lovely actionable work on the pedagogical implications of chatbots <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx413" title="">413</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx414" title="">414</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx415" title="">415</a>]</cite>. This could transform the way visitors engage with exhibits, providing a more immersive and personalized experience.
</p></div>

<section id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx11">
<h6>Alioscopy</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx11.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx11.p1.1">Alioscopy uses a different approach than lenticular lenses for their glasses-free 3D displays. Their screens contain a parallax barrier - a layer of opaque and transparent slits - over the LCD matrix. This directs different pixel columns to each eye, creating a stereoscopic 3D image without glasses.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx11.p2">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx11.p2.1">Their displays also incorporate proprietary eye tracking technology. An infrared camera follows the viewer’s head position, automatically adjusting the angle of the projected 3D image for optimal viewing. This compensates for display viewing angle limitations.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx11.p3">
<p id="Ch10.S9.SS1.SSSx11.p3.1">Alioscopy’s recent prototypes feature very high resolution like 4K and 8K to improve 3D image quality. Their barriers and tracking algorithms are precisely tuned to the display characteristics and desired viewing parameters.</p></div>

<h4>
<span>10.10 </span>Accessible metaverse for pre-viz</h4>
<div id="Ch10.S10.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S10.p1.1">Pre-visualization (or "pre-viz") is a process in which a rough simulation of a visual effect or scene is created prior to its actual production. In the context of LED wall virtual production, pre-viz refers to the creation of a 3D representation of a virtual environment, including the placement of cameras, actors, and other elements, that is then used to plan and test the visual effects and lighting for a live-action scene that will eventually be shot in front of an LED wall.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S10.p2">
<p id="Ch10.S10.p2.1">The pre-viz process allows filmmakers and visual effects artists to experiment with different camera angles, lighting, and visual effects before committing to a final version. This helps to save time and resources during actual production by reducing the need for multiple takes or re-shoots. Additionally, it allows the filmmakers to see how the final product will look before committing to it, which can help to avoid costly mistakes or changes down the line.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S10.p3">
<p id="Ch10.S10.p3.1">The LED wall virtual production process typically involves using a combination of 3D animation software, motion capture technology, and real-time rendering to create a virtual environment that accurately reflects the physical environment in which the scene will be shot. The pre-viz process is then used to plan and test the various visual effects, lighting, and camera angles that will be used in the final production.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S10.p4">
<p id="Ch10.S10.p4.1">Our collaborative software stack is potentially ideally suited to some of this pre-viz work, especially when combined with the power of machine learning, and live linked into Unreal so that changes by stakeholders enter the pre-production pipeline in a seamless way.</p></div>

To describe how this might work, the set designer, DP, director, etc will be able to ideate in a headset based metaverse of the set design, dropping very basic chairs, windows, light sources whatever. There is -no need- then to create a scene in detail. If the interframe consistency (img2img) can deliver then the output on the VP screen can simply inherit the artistic style from the text prompts, and render production quality from the basic building blocks. Everyone in the set (or just DP/director) could then switch in headset to the final output and ideate (verbally) to create the look and feel (lens, bokeh, light, artistic style etc). This isn’t ready yet as the frames need to generate much faster (100x), but it’s very likely coming in months not years. This “next level pre-vis” is being trailed in the Vircadia collaborative environment described in this book, and can be seen illustrated in Figure <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch10.F5" title="Figure 10.5 ‣ 10.11 Novel VP render pipeline ‣ Chapter 10 Our proposition ‣ Part I State of the art"><span>10.5</span></a>.</p></div>

<p id="Ch10.S11.p2.1">This can be done now through the use of camera robots. A scene can be built in basic outline, the camera tracks can be encoded into the robot, and the scene can be rapidly post rendered by Stability with high inter frame consistency.</p></div>

<p id="Ch10.S12.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1">In the book “Ghosts of my life” <cite>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx416" title="">416</a>]</cite> Fisher asserts that there has been a slowing, even a ‘cancellation’ of creative progress in developed societies, their art, and their media. His contention is that neoliberalism itself is to blame. He says
<br><span id="Ch10.S12.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1.1">“It is the contention of this book that 21st-century culture is marked by the same anachronism and inertia which afflicted Sapphire and Steel in their final adventure. But this status has been buried, interred behind a superficial frenzy of ‘newness’, of perpetual movement. The ‘jumbling up of time’, the montaging of earlier eras, has ceased to be worthy of comment; it is now so prevalent that it is no longer even noticed.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S12.SS0.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch10.S12.SS0.SSSx1.p2.1">It is the feeling of the authors of this book that the creative and inspirational efforts of the whole world may be needed to heal these deep wounds. It is possible that by connecting creatives with very different global perspectives, directly into ‘Western’ production pipelines, that we will be able to see the shape of this potential.</p></div>

We have some thinking on this which links the external web to our proposed metaverse. There is work in the community working on economically empowered bots which leverage Nostr and RGB to perform functions within our metaverse, and outside in the WWW, as well as interacting economically through trusted cryptography with other bots, anywhere, and human participants, anywhere. This is incredibly powerful and is assured by the Bitcoin security model. Imagine being able to interact with a bot flower seller representing all the real world florists it had found. In the metaverse you could handle the flowers and take advice and guidance from the bot agent, then it would be able to take your money to buy you flowers to send to a real world address, and later find you to tell you when it’s delivered. These possibilities are endless. The AI chat element, the AI translation of images on websites to 3D assets in the Metaverse are difficult but possible challenges, but the secure movement of money from the local context in the metaverse to the real world is within reach using these bots, and they are completely autonomous and distributed.</p></div>

<p id="Ch10.S13.SS0.SSSx1.p1.1">We will base our identity and object management on Nostr public/private key pairs. The public key of these enable lightning based exchange of value globally. we plan to operate Nostr in multiple modes. Linking flossverse “rooms” will be a Nostr bot to bot system within the private relay mesh. This can also synchronise large amounts of data by leveraging torrents <a href="https://iris.to/#/settings" title="">negotiated by Nostr</a>. Human to human text chat across and within instances is two ’types’ kind of private nostr tag within the private relays mesh. External connectivity to web and nostr apps is just the public relay tags outbound. We don’t need to store data external to the flossverse system, though access is obviously possible through the same torrent network.</p></div>

It should be too costly to attack an individual aggressively. This implies an increased weighting for scores issued in short time periods.

They are trivial to make but I am unsure of the business case as they don’t <span id="Ch10.S15.I5.i2.p1.1.1">trigger</span> that unique thing that people seem to like.

<h6>Preferred options: LNP/BP and RGB</h6>
<div id="Ch10.S15.SS4.SSSx1.p1">
<p id="Ch10.S15.SS4.SSSx1.p1.1"><a href="https://giacomozucco.com/layers-before-bitcoin" title="">LNP/BP</a> is a non profit standards organisation in Switzerland which contributes to open source development of Bitcoin layer 3 solutions into the Lightning protocol, and Bitcoin protocol (LNP/BP). One of the core product developments within their work is the <a href="https://www.rgb.tech/" title="">‘RGB’ protocol</a>, which is somewhat of a meaningless name, evolved from “coloured coins” which were an early tokenised asset system on the Bitcoin network. RGB represents red, green, and blue. The proposal is built upon research by <a href="https://petertodd.org/2016/commitments-and-single-use-seals" title="">Todd</a> and <a href="https://giacomozucco.com/#intro" title="">Zucco</a>. RGB is regarded as arcane Bitcoin technology, even within the already rarefied Bitcoin developer communities. Zucco provides the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/video-interview-giacomo-zucco-rgb-tokens-built-bitcoin" title="">following explanation</a>:</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S15.SS4.SSSx1.p2">
<p id="Ch10.S15.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1"><span id="Ch10.S15.SS4.SSSx1.p2.1.1">“When I want to send you a bitcoin, I will sign the transaction, I will give the transaction only to you, you will be the only one verifying, and then we’ll take a commitment to this transaction and that I will give only the commitment to miners. Miners will basically build a blockchain of commitments, but without the actual validation part. That will be only left to you. And when you want to send the assets to somebody else, you will pass your signature, plus my signature, plus the previous signature, and so on.”</span></p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S15.SS4.SSSx1.p3">
<p id="Ch10.S15.SS4.SSSx1.p3.1">This is non-intuitive explanation of Todds ‘single-use-seals’, applied to Bitcoin, with the purpose of underpinning arbitrary asset transfer secured by the Bitcoin network. In this model the transacting parties are the exclusive holders of the information about what the object they are transferring actually represents. This primitive can (and has) been expanded by the LNP/BP group into a concept called ‘client side validation’.
It’s appropriate to explain this concept several times from different perspectives, because this is potentially a profoundly useful technology for metaverse applications.</p></div>

Crucially, this is not conceptually the same as the highly expressive ‘layer one’ chains which offer this functionality within their chain logic. In those systems there is a globally available shared consensus of ‘state’. In the LNP/BP technologies the state data is owned, controlled, and stored by the transacting parties. Bitcoin provides the crytographic external proof of a state change in the event of a proof being required. This is an elegant solution in that it takes up virtually no space on the blockchain, is private by design, and is extensible to layer 2 protocols like Lightning.</p></div>

This can be considered an additional network liquidity problem on top of Lightning, and is the essence of the “Layer 3” moniker associated with LNP/BP. It will require a great number of such nodes to successfully launch token transfer on Lightning.

It permits the creation and direct transaction of Unique Digital Assets (UDAs), akin to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), on Bitcoin without the necessity of other tokens. UDAs are special digital assets linked to a Bitcoin UTXO (unspent transaction output). These assets embody distinctive attributes like ownership, transferability, and divisibility, and remain under the full control and ownership of their creators.</p></div>
<div id="Ch10.S15.SS4.SSSx2.p2">
<p id="Ch10.S15.SS4.SSSx2.p2.1">Through DIBA, users can explore, purchase, and sell a vast array of UDAs, taking advantage of the robustness and permanence of the Bitcoin blockchain.

        Enable MongoDB’s free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
        metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

        The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
        and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
        improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

        To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
        To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()

<a href="https://docs.vyos.io/en/equuleus/configuration/nat/index.html#hairpin-nat-nat-reflection" title="">VyOS

updates to the existing rules that have been configured. NAT reflection
would be useful for internal only debugging, however, in testing the ICE
server from the build would only bind to the external internet routable
IP thus hindering the ability to use internally. As using ICE for
internal only is an edge case this is actually as expected although
future work could look into updating the ICE server and configuring
split DNS (feel free to update with suggestions). With this in mind the
setup described here, at present, does not require NAT reflection but
the following updates should enable it if desired:</p></div>
